       "'in pandemic several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world the players are diseasefighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of handthe game board depicts several major population centers on earth on each turn a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities treat infected populaces discover a cure or build a research station a deck of cards provides the players with these abilities but sprinkled throughout this deck are epidemic cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases activity a second separate deck of cards controls the quotnormalquot spread of the infectionstaking a unique role within the team players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists strengths in order to conquer the diseases for example the operations expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities the scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal fivemdashbut the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out if one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses the players all lose if they cure the four diseases they all winthe  edition of pandemic includes two new charactersmdashthe

quinedwhitegoblingames rebelspzoo siamboardgames stratelibri wargamesclubpublishing whitegoblingames zhiyanjia    super coop great cooperative game lots of fun got this in  because my wife and i needed time to kill we love playing this game together                       a blast with my family 4 games and 2 wins in simplest mode if we have gathered together in this squad more often than once per month it would have had a lot more plays i already bought on the brink expansion and im waiting for perfect moment to include it im especially intrigued by the ekoterrorist mode for solo mode id prefer cthulhu version as i love such grim and evil atmosphere but i know that it wouldnt hit the table at all with family and buying both version is a bit too much for my wallet a game of logistics i liked pandemic a lot when i first got into the hobby cooperative games were such a interesting novel concept at this point however ive played so many games of it including season 1 that im pretty happy to not play the base game any more it can be prone to quarterbacking and the decisions you make arent that interesting especially when compared with newer titles  complexity  immersion  production  replayability  interaction  depth took a few tries to fully grasp the rulesbut once understood was a brilliant game its collaborative goal is great to see how other people play games really enjoy the game pieces and would definitely recommend must have  min 14 players coop game different difficulty levels superb gateway game that a lot of people seem to like lately it hasnt been getting a lot of plays like it used to partly because the game has gotten a bit been there done that but it has earned a firm spot in my collection nonetheless great theme great mechanics and great production yes its more fun to play this one solo erast 10 ewejka 95 awesome coop easy to setup and gamepaly goes from beginner to ultimate challenge providing hours of replay value coop game starting to grow tired of it though my friends have not still its never failed to entertain plus the expansion promises to add some novelty back in cooperative game with intriguing game mechanism  someone else can play your part  you can relax and wait for orders from the other players d im not the person who figures stuff out if someone else does it for me i love this game fairly easy to explain and very enjoyable for new players probably the best nonarkham cooperative game but still not great gameplay is a bit rote wheres the nearest spot the dispatcher can teleport us to where we can exchange cards and it doesnt have the thickness of theme or drama inherent to skill checks that arkham does that makes it all worthwhile awesome gateway game and a perennial favorite we always play with the on the brink expansion roles the mutation and the virulent strain epidemic cards these can be added one at a time to increase complexity something i am down for at any time good game easy and quick to set up once you know how it works enjoy playing it the most when theres 2 players so far playing with 4 has been the worst i like the idea of pandemic more than the game its a neat theme saving the world from a global plague i also like the system which is very cleverespecially how it spreads the diseases and creates hot spots on the map it just doesnt pull me in thoughalso its the poster boy for the idea that cooperative games tend to be played by one person who tells everyone else what to do all that being said boy pandemic legacy was a blast alpha gamers i have not idea why i enjoy this it always seem like you are so closing to winning or losing need people who play well with each other this is my first board game i played this at a rpg convention and my eyes opened to the board game scene it has been 3 years since then and i love playing games more than ever in this game the tension is growing slowly and then when an epidemic card is drawn it is just a matter of time before outbreaks happen and the game gets out of control i love the asymmetric tension this mechanic provides other than that the hand management aspect is fine but nothing revolutionary i also like the fact that every character has a fun special ability when you are the medic you feel good if you clean 3 cubes with an action overall i really like this game and recommend it to people starting their collections and looking for a good filler a good puzzle to be solved by the players but not really a game in its own right i do enjoy playing and teaching it to others just prone to having ine player try to run the whole game requires a ton of coordination and metagaming  hence imo the generalized low rating very hard game but still fun probably just a steep learning curve to get the win rate to a more normal level really good fun  but the worst thing about this game  the anticlimax from winning my first coop game lots of fun easy and consistent rules player have 4 actions per turn travel 4 types cure build station share knowledge then draw 2 cards next draw city infections cards strong and compact box  big plus for this lacerta it can be very hard best cooperativ game great game slightly too reliant on the randomness arrangement in the arrangement of the decks but a solid cooperative game finally tried the game that everyone will recommende you if youre searching for a good cooperative game that works well with only 2 players it was indeed entertaining although we lost pretty heavily i must admit haha and i would replay it again despite all this no matter how good this game is i think the hype is a bit too inflated for what it is dont get me wrong ill play it again i just dont think its a staple for every 10 best board games ever list solid game usually challenging to the point of sometimes feeling unfair sadly it is harder to get excited for this after pandemic legacy which is just amazing play count only includes sessions with physical copy of game game app plays are not included in total easily one of the best solo gaming experiences out there wonderful game a whole lot of teamwork and putting everyones heads together to determine exactly what to do where and when a great cooperative what is awesome is that this game is easily teachable to new players and since it isnt competitive it isnt intimidating however with uncooperative pushy jerks this is insufferable fura volt hogy 4 a csal di j t kok rangsor ban de val ban a 10  s a 12  ves gyerekeim is im dt k i absolutely love the cooperative aspect of this game with lots of talking with friends over what to do next every game is completely different and the game is always right down to the wire my wife finds this just ok but she historically doesnt care for cooperative games everyone else has fallen in love with it immediately we now play this game with 3 or more people and my wife agrees that its much much better than with just 2 people weve now played 8 or 9 games in the last two weeks and finally have our first win with that group we now always look forward to future plays not a bad little game of player cooperation in the face of impending global catastrophe i liked the discussions as players debated the best possible moves each turn an amazing coop game where the theme and the gameplay mesh very well a little luckbased but not in a way that ruins the immersion i also love the way that the game has different difficulty settings to choose from heart  game of the year heart  top 100 11 first top 100  top 100 17  top 100 23  top 100 22  top 100 29  top 100 59 quick playing easy to learn hard to win tense atmosphere high replayability great game game i can play with my girlfriend but she likes battle line and qwirkle more rarely hits the table first game i bought when i got back into the hobby i love coops and puzzles all game endings are close though we lose most of the time its a classic coop its biggest weakness being the vulnerability to quarterbacking by alpha gamers but id recommend newcomers consider running through the brilliant pandemic legacy season 1 instead since it starts out as the base game anyway i also prefer the hardtofind iberia version my favorite of the many variants of this game as well as the in the lab expansion although it is admittedly more complex its a modern classic for a reason this coop was groundbreaking in its challenging but still streamlined and quite intuitive mechanics the best parts are probably  the outbreak mechanic which has been copied by numerous other coops  the way epidemics work is ingenious in an evil way  how powerful the different roles are and how well they work in combination for four newbies it didnt feel that easy even with just four epidemic cards but i guess itll get better with experience tabletop tbgd chhomami d65star my favourite coop game by far i like the look and feel of the game and its components wow best cop game out there bar none this is the coop game ive been looking for since i normally hate them since they are either group think or one person takes charge what a tight game hard to beat and oozes with theme very nice a cooperative game all ive played with loves it  fun cooperative game played it with 2 and 4 players it seems to scale very well with four players there are simply more options for what to do the game it self is very random with the draw of a card being able to end things very quickly this is not a problem for me dealing with a global pandemic has never been so much fun  played one 4 player openhand introductory game theres really not much going on in the game still its interesting and intense its very well balanced you need to make some good decitions and have a little luck when drawing cards in order to beat the game im getting a feeling this is a kind of solitare puzzle game thats been tweaked to allow for multiple players cooperating on solving the puzzle definitely needs some more play received  in spillorama ix  mathtrade on the brink expansion in the lab expansion state of emergency expansion pandemic 10th anniversary hmmm i dont see the pull of this game the unusual card mechanic is nice but the whole game feels like a stripped down cooperative game without much pop i prefer to play ffgs arkham horror where you have some character development and more decisions in pandemic the theme feels pastedon and the gameplay feels forced ie having to go to the city named on the card in order to pass it to another player enjoyable coop game i need to play this again though this was my gateway game it drew me into this hobby so quick and it is also the game i most recommend to people fun fun fun   haha ok can you detect my enthusiasm coop is such a fun way to play especially if youve never experienced it before i like the theme who doesnt fear viruses taking over the world the anxiety in the game can be tense but in a good way highly recommend i heard its better with some expansions we finally won tense and exciting ending good game an excellent game and i am always wanting to play it every card you turn makes you cringei love it it plays just as well with 2 players as it does with 4 seem to have lost this as a lend out to someone standard 635 x 88 mm my family is not ready to save the world we routinely get our ass kicked by this game i have fun though finding different ways to lose still i do enjoy this one great fun game still playing in easy mode 4 pandemic carts limited options for strategy but this is an excellent option to spend 30 to 45 minutes of fun with your couple of family once we get more experience well definitively try the legacy ones coop elegance in a box this is the game that got me into modern boardgaming it was also my first coop and i knew as soon as i played it that i loved it and needed more like it playing it with a software engineer physics teacher and licensed counselor at the same time was fascinating fun fun concept with the coop but there isnt much complexity to the game fun once or twice with any given group of people not much more although this is pretty grim subject matter its still a crackerjack coop game that really demands teamwork because of its challenging nature veteran players are often tempted to dictate moves to novices and this tends to diminish the experience a bit this is a great collaborative game we just played at the game night its great for our family lots of analytical interaction and working together it was a lot of intense fun im also interested in the theme now that ive been reading white plague this is the game that got me into modern boardgames my favorite game so far one of the best coop games out there  tried a 5p game with 4 epidemics we won pretty easily in fact also played 3p heroic and finished the game with all 4 diseases eradicated and not a single outbreak  played 2 games with 3 players on heroic tonight and it had a similar feel to 4 player normal i think i like it better with 3 players though less waiting and fewer people to cause bickering  played 2 more 4pnormal games lost both soon before curing the 4th disease outbreak city  we played x2 with 4 players on heroic and we got owned then we played 4 players on normal and lost 1 turn from victory twice finally we played 3 player on normal and won easily im concerned about the percentage of games that are probably unwinnable from the outset which i suspect is high with 4 players especially on heroic  ive played about 4 times and have yet to really lose this game seems kinda easy maybe im just getting lucky it seems like the game is either winnable or not from the outset of course you dont know that it could be the case that the game setup is simply unwinnable ive not really lost yet so i dont know how true that ispandemic is a very slick attempt at a cooperative game the main problem with it isnt a problem with the game perse its a problem with the genre some people complain that games like race for the galaxy are multiplayer solitaire this game isnt mulitplayer solitaire its just solitaireall the cooperative games i can think of suffer from this same problem one domineering loud or stubborn player basically plays everyones hand in fact in order to maximize the chances of winning this is really the optimal strategy ideally everyone collaborates to determine the best course for everyone but that one loud guy can ruin the fun for the other players by saying you do this you do this and you do this the best or at least a sufficient coarse of action can be easily constructed by any one person theres no real need for collaborative input  great game for the family easy to learn with a great depth of strategic complexity to master neat game cool premise look forward to playing it again excellent cooperative game which i would consider an essential for any gaming enthusiast pandemic presents an interesting puzzle to be solved every game replayability is decentwe have logged 25 plays and difficulty is easily adjusted luck can be a big factorone game ended in a loss after the second players first turn we laughed and reset we still pull this out on occasion must have modern classic easy to play beautiful components and tones of fun this is a good one for introduce nongamers to this amazing world owned on ios pandemic is great to start with but slips the more you play it better to learn the game with the app and then jump into legacy d need to try out one player bioterrorist version is amazing my favourite i like to play games where players have to play against the board id love to see the instructions to be translated in estonian to or maybe i should do this myself interesting game easy rules but can be difficult to win fantastic coop game smooth and elegant mechanics challenging always fun to play a superb game that is a great way to introduce new players to board games house rule 1  only you can talk on your turn unless asking someone specifically for advice the only game that my wife really likes it is ultimately like playing a game of solitaire as a team but the gameplay makes it ohso tense and the components are lovely edit now enjoying this with my 9 yearold twins 5 unlogged plays quick and exciting also difficult upgrade the medic is great but doesnt help you win just gives you more time i like that all of the roles are equally strongimportant im an opex fan simple cooperative that mix what i like in the genre engaging challenging fast die mutter aller koopspiele ein musthave in jeder sammlung i dont really understand the pandemic hype at all the game is fun and interesting but in my experience it usually turns in to one or two players telling everyone how to play their turns the game can be very hard and that is the best part of this game a great game a classic can be fun i thought it would be good to try out a groupbased board game instead of games where you always go it alone again depends on the crowd fun challenging and deeply strategic pandemic has great replayability and even experienced gamers find this one challenging on the harder difficulties however this one seems susceptible to alpha gamer syndrome as one player could easily start directing the others as to what to do first play impression was ok would play again but this is not hotness fun tense quick cooperative game  managed to get it on pozy my brother who is not really a gamer suggested we play again after we lost the first game he played in which we did and won i asked him later if he would play in the future and he said yes insert venduto a stefano deve darmi soldi tons of fun easy to learn hard to beat the world can become very chaotic very quickly one overly controlling ubergamer can completely ruin the experience though 24p one of the first well known cooperative games sometimes its not too hard sometimes its diabolical i enjoy playing this but not all the time only down side is that one player who is thinking three steps ahead of everyone else might start getting bossy about what everyone else needs to do if youve never played a truly cooperative game before this is a great place to start and easy to find too target barnes and noble one player tells others what to do not very enjoyable game very good cooperative game light enough for a beginner to pick up in a few minutes enough variation to warrant multiple replays fun and very tense cooperative scales very nicely with number of players and with easily adjusted difficulty setting which is good because wow do we suck this game clocks us far more than it should damn you yellow cubes the central mechanic of putting back the cards when the epidemic cards are drawn is clever and the theme evokes a certain urgency still for a solocooperative game i think id personally prefer a different theme eg ghost stories maybe you could retheme it i saw someone had crafted a doctor who version id play that and im not even a doctor who fan sept  got a lot of play then once worked out very little maybe needs that expansion expansions on the brink in the lab not a big fan of the system loaned out the smiths yes theres a tendency for one or two players to dominate the game making less experienced and less extravert gamers have to sit back and follow orders keep your hands to yourselves though not necessarily secret as one step to counteract this apart from that its a veeery intense very exciting game and it always surprises new gamers how the well the cooperative mode works great cooperative game ideal for family play relatively simple to learn but requires good strategy and cordination to avoid the inevitable escalating  cascading infection outbreaks one of the best coops out there awesome game in its core mechanic matematically perfection and statistic rule the game from the beginning to the end anxiety and stress will be your companions all game long extremely satisfying in victory extremely frustrating in defeat must have one of the best games around first game ended in 2 turns lots of communication and teamwork involved no alphas in group which made it better not an easy game to win played 5 epidemic cards good intro to more complex games can play with my 8 yo good game but sometimes hate it love hate relationship with it think its been overplayed by everyone now especially due to legacy which i have no interest in  lin owns like new played once smoke free home cooperative problem solving quite puzzlelike but thats not a bad thing fantastic cooperative game suffers from serious quarterbacking but a fantastically simple game that is great for new and seasoned players the standard by which all coop games are measured and rightly so the theme is great it keeps challenging has a nice ebb and flow to it and is short enough that repeated losses dont cause too much frustration pandemic is one of the most critically acclaimed coop board games out there but if you ask me this game is a snooze fest the game is simply too simple as a guy who does math all day this game comes straight down to probability once you have a solid basis of what you are doing and that bothers me to no end if youre looking for a game to introduce people to the coop genre i suppose this could work for a bit but with games like zombicide the lord of the rings card game and arkham horror out there id pass on this one traded for 4 gods i like this game but i own forbidden island and that seems to scratch the same itch and is more friendly to kids and casual gamers eclipsed by iberia its beautiful how the disease outbreaks develop in this game i was absolutely floored the first time i played as i watched the world get overrun and so damn fast by a disease we didnt think was even overlythreatening the big problem with this game is that it tends to get played for you  there are obvious best moves to take and since its such a difficult game and you really do want to win experienced players have an incentive to try to tell you what to do this kind of leads to one person taking charge and that can be dull for some folks which is a shame because experiencing that out of control outbreak is a oneofakind moment early when i was starting my gaming collection this seemed like it should be an auto include everyone online loved it and said it was a great way to get people into gaming i was a bit disappointed with it my wife and i enjoyed it the first few times we played it but after you know what to do everything just becomes automatic and either it works out or it doesnt sometimes the order of the cards is just too cruel and you cannot win but often just doing the obvious things to do gets you there pandemic also suffers from what i generally dislike in cooperative games the guy who owns the game and explains it to everyone knows how to win so he gets put in the awkward situation of telling everyone how to win or letting them fend for themselves and watch as the game implodes neither option is very fun for me and none of our games have ended with wow that was a lot of fun lets play again outstanding fun coop several virulent diseases have broken out all over the world you are disease fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand you must work together and plan your strategy to mesh with each of you special strengths a game of tough choices strategy and teamwork the most successful coop game ever i suspect clever set of mechanisms that provide enough of a challenge to keep drawing you in with increasing levels of difficulty great to play with people who are turn off by competitive board games andor couples repeat play and uneven experience with the game is more likely to lead to alpha gamers ruining the experience for others the best coop boardgame in my opinion i never thought coop gaming could be this fun good game with a good range of features coop play makes it interesting it is a little easy after a few playthroughs and does get a little samey good theme nice cubes always challenging especially with expansions and just great fun probably best coop game what i can say about it it is hard to understand takes a long time and makes you think twice until making a move so let me explain a little more about this game usually if you want to play pandemic for the first time play with 4 epidemics and if possible with a person that already played the game at least once to be sure that you have a chance for the first time you can take also your characters because in 2 its even harder not necessary in 4 dont forget about the 7 cards in the hand its very important look at the game and search for cities that have already 3 cubes on them you dont want explosions or other infections look at the infection deck remember what cities were infected earlier what have 23 cubes on the table etc read the small rule card that every player has in case you forgot something usually for transport it usually takes more then 1h  in case is you play for the first time try to find cures dont eradicate them if you dont have time or cards i think its the best game that i have played ever on this idea of cooperative playing for sure i will take an expansion on it  this is a classic one now and its a great gateway boardgame im not going into details youll find many comments out there but this is a great start if you want to do a coop for dutch players i had some issues with my gameguide when i bought the dutch version bought the english one just to avoid the annoyance the theme does nothing for me but the design is excellent and it is a classic for a reason a fun game that only seems to get better the more i play it still a good game but it hasnt held up for me over time the king of thriller cooperative a chain reaction game not 10 because the luck factor remains a bit strong 4 defeats  1 victory after 6 plays we finally managed to beat the game on regular difficulty up to that point we lost every way possible and eventually decided that to boost moral wed all sponsor a different disease and if that disease was the one that killed us then that player won very satisfying cooperative game without too many complicated rules very elegant and fun got a little boring after 40 plays or so but a good one for quite a while 4 on the cindometer good game easy to learn and sometimes can be quite challenging great for playing with family or nongaming friends reddit beginner recommendation pandemic if youre looking for a cooperative game this is probably this best game that you can show to anyone frankly i like forbidden desert more but im part of the minority for that pandemic also has some expansions which most people suggest you get if you like the base game and are looking for more opportunities with this game a very good co op game we played this a lot it s always a challenge if i hadn t read that other players found it to be hard to defeat i would have been discouraged the stiff challenge is by design otherwise it would be boring a very good multiplayer coop game probably second to only betrayal imo i havent played it with a ton of different people but the one person takes over and tells everyone what to do doesnt seem to happen very often i can see it happening if played with a group of nongamers cuz they just trust you know best but amoungst gamers it seems to work well the role cards play a key part in this imo it promotes everyone giving their input and asking the group if they agree its in the best interest of the group to do x the mechanics of the game as well really give you the flavor of epidemic outbreak if an outbreak happened in a particular city its going to continue again and again havent played it solo as of yet but with the different levels of difficulty i could easily see it being very fun very good cooperative game  one of the best very well balanced high replayability simple to explain quick but also pretty much challenging thumbsup save the world yo 9 plays before first win also have threat level six expansion it doesnt look like much in fact i didnt buy it for years because it didnt look like my kind of game a map ooooohinteresting but then i gave it a shot and loved it my family also loves to play even my mother which never happens 25 great game its a modern classic for a reason brilliant fun fun and  quick to play outstanding coop love it for solo play as well can suffer from one person taking over for a game with a good amount of randomness i dont seem to mind it in an ultra competitive household this coop has proved challenging however the theme and mechanics make it a firm favourite nothing to say that hasnt been said a million times great opener great intro to the hobby downside being that experienced players tend to steamroll newer players 45 min 2 4 players p2 p3 p4 weight 241  5 bought  gigamesh i love cooperative games session report httpwwwboardgamegeekcomthreaddowehavewhatittakestosavehumanityhmmwell i enjoy this on occasion usually play it in succession it amazing how fast this game can turn and kick you in the arse best coop game out there imo good for all ages takes a while to learn the rules and get how things work but once the turn dynamic is clear the game plays fast 716 6  drop to 5 obviously a groundbreaking game but after having played so many games especially pandemic legacy i dont feel myself drawn to this one much more 119 5 v with both on the brink and in the lab awesome cooperative game the rules are straightforward so its easy to learn and to explain to new players but the tension and also the challenge increases as the game progresses which makes it great fun to play the role cards have different special abilities which provides more variability and so you need to work together as a team to make the most of everyones special abilities this game is highly replayable and allows for you to increase your difficulty by adding additional epidemic cards 4  beginners 5  normal 6  hard i love this game its sooo addictive and great value for money     mayday card game 635     88    2   and app family friends not yet playedenjoyed the 2 plays so far a classic and it still holds up finely balanced its not impossibly difficult whilst still presenting a challenge and easy to get into for new and inexperienced gamers theres a great game arc as well as the pressure ramps up toward the end with every game finely balanced a great design this is growing on me as an interesting cooperative experience and im looking forward to exploring it more the mechanism that drives repeat infections in the same cities in a relatively simple way is very welldesigned grintxitos gamefit big box ordered i really like this game but i think it highly depends on the people you play it with some people seem to like if others tell them what to do  i dont like those sessions i like it when all 4 players are involved and high fiving each other after getting rid of an infection fun game once we beat it on hard at a convention we did not want to touch it anymore i dont plan on popping it back open but its a great coop game and i think everyone moved on to pandemic legacysooo alpha player issues otherwise very original alltime number one game substance versus rules complexity ratio i like being the healer so jesuslike light enough to play after a couple of pints or even a game of arkham this is another game that has improved by playing with the right crowd would play the lovecraft version of pandemic rather than this vanilla version of the game  i enjoy the theme more one of my favourite family games i dont know maybe im just too competitive and like beating other people with a superior strategy more than i like beating a piece of cardboard with a superior strategy but i want to like this game more than i actually do pretty good game my one complaint is that its too much like forbidden island maybe i should have given this one the 9 and the other one an 8 if this one came first i never looked it up i do really like cooperative board games with the kids though  it gets our brains working in completely different ways i play usually as a solo game and it is always challenging 01 including expansions my wifes favorite game its fairly simple and straightforward to play the difficulty is perfect for a players vs the game coop winning is a real achievement and every game comes down to the wire leaving us on the edge of our seat the entire time we get better results playing with 2 but upping it to 4 really increases the challenge for our groups a solid game but im not a good team player i prefer to be able to backstab my friends  would like to give it another go i just dont find this game fun or interesting possibly the best coop game great game and very thematic one of the best cooperative games ever great fun and can be frustrating to beat if the cards fall poorly for you you can play this solitaire as it is a coop game new edition contains the original game  a few roles from the first expansion pack 43 fun as long as you dont play with control freaks then it turns into one player optimization depth medium light           fun factor 810 theme 710 game mechanics 710 components quality 610 rules 810 originality 810 replayability 610 strategy 710           total 71             simple and appealing to light gamers and nongamers but really not my cup of tea the theme is an interesting one and the gameplay is obviously derived from it to a certain extent but there are clear sacrifices to playability and gaminess that quickly make the actual gameplay about counting cubes my biggest gripe is that the deck has the biggest impact on whether the players win or lose perfect play wont beat a bad draw and bad play will do just fine with a good draw its remarkably frustrating and i dont exactly feel like im getting much better at this game because its pretty easy to hit the initial threshold of good play from then on youre just along for the ride as the game decides if its winnable or not i think my biggest complaint about the base game is that i just do not enjoy it with only 2 players my favorite feature about coop games is the discussion and strategy planning it just isnt as much fun with only two players but this is just me i know a lot of people love this game with only 2 players and if i did i would definitely rank it higher its certainly one of the best early cooperative games coonabarabran a pretty fun coop game but it can go off the rails quickly with a couple bad draws i need to get more plays in but its a really difficult game would keep we have played this a few times interesting idea cooperative instead of competitive which is nice for a family environment i have the feeling that after we play a few more times we wont play it again because i think the idea might get a little stale it often seems like we are winning until the last few minutes when suddenly we get our butts kicked four games in the first day plays very fast more a light filler than core game for me i think it is fun enough but dont see it becoming a staple for me thematically cool and a fun simple concept but for me a if i want to like a coop it needs to do something about the dominant player aspect there needs to be information open to only some players or a traitor etc that prevents everyone just openly discussing the best play and some players not actively doing much pandemic has no such thing which leaves this as only a 1 or 2 player exercise for me and too simple at that its just a simple risk calculation which cities to clean up awesome game good for online video play if all have the board use one as a master board wouldnt choose to play it but i find it a great game to play with people newer to board games fun coop game not a bad gateway game bit to prone to quarterbacking however best with 14 a pure cooperative an excelent gateway tense and fun perfect for the family its different everytime you play which makes a game plenty of replayability amazing game look out for the outbreaks fun cooperative game there is a lot going on which makes it a challenge for new players but the cooperative nature encourages those who have played before to help others out 24 fun and thematic and it plays very quickly another great coop game fantastic game for us with a theme thats right in my sweet spot my son doesnt like a lot of conflict at this stage so his first question now whenever i pull out a new game is is it cooperative he and i have played this together a few times now i let him be the medic each time since it makes him feel powerful to be able to wipe out multiple cubes within a city and it keeps him interested in playing and enjoyed every play i also love the fact that it can be played solo since i dont always have readily available playing partners its alright maybe the expansions make this a must own its not a must own w base game so many people love this game i am missing something i guess but after a few meh plays its impossible to get to the table 21   the best cooperative game ive played thus far will probably buy it someday too    dropped down to an 8 still a great game lots of fun i need to work on not giving people a chance to come up with an idea of what they should do before i blurt out my own ideas ha ha just dropped because i dont always want to play it its a little complicated to set up and i dont know ha ha r1 r2 r3 br4 solid coop game a little lighter than zombicide  dead of winter but more bang for you buck than forbidden island 6 plays ive decided i dont like coop as much as id thought while skill and cooperation can certainly help you do well while playing this game breaking the games code is much more beneficial other people weve introduced the game to enjoyed it as did my wife for me its a calculation exercise fine component production very nicely laid out rules solid gameplay in terms of objective quality if such a thing actually existed id rate this game a 8 in terms of my desire to play this game again id rate this game a 3 or 4 note to self cherry valley game is a solid 810 on its own but the on the brink expansion makes pandemic a complete package making it a  for me with just the addition of on the brink one of the best entry level board games ever  lots of fun and easy to play while still challenginggreat way to lure in newbies love this game to death such a great and simple concept and at least for me always feels like we win by the skin of our teeth probably the best pure coop game i know of good for when you are in the coop mood can come down to luck a bit much though everyone gets rainbow hands 5 of the 12 blue cards are in the bottom 8 back to back epidemics etc pandemic is fine it s just middleoftheroad fine i mean okay it s fine it s a game it ll do do you have a game we could play i have pandemic um ok i suppose i mean it s fine it s something one of the few games that my wife will play pandemic is a cooperative game that doesnt relent you and your medical team are assigned roles and thrust into a world with rampaging virii just when you think you have the upper hand an outbreak occurs infecting and possible reinfecting cities then the cards are shuffled and placed back on the draw pile thats right those cities are going to be visited by the virus threat again i like how each person has a unique role teamwork is critical to success your actions have meaningful consequences to the game it is up to all of you have fun and best luck as far as coop games go i measure them all to this granted i havent played space alert or fire rescue but if im playing a coop game im choosing this maybe i dont feel like im actually eradicating viruses but the urgency is felt the entire game coop game for up to 4 players i love cooperative games and this is one of the best though dd is of course top of the pile this tends to be the goto family game because it the one we can all play without trying to kill each other  oldy but goldy excellent cooperative game 4 player great cooperative the base game is a little weak but if the new roles are included this really improves the gameplay this is my 85 rating sold to ari much fun in cooperative play have enjoyed every single session i played this one it can be a little frustrating at times but winning feels great especially if youve taken on the harder challenges and made it through i find it really fun as a solo game 2 player games are also fun maybe try to use some more epidemics next time i like coops and really like this game varying the roles number and type of epidemics still keeps it fresh my favorite gateway playfully cooperative and very thematic it is just a perfect game a little more frantic than i like simple rules a lot of fun and discussions between all players you really have to act quickly otherwise the game will make big trouble the game components are high class  with the petri dishes leading the way i definetely have to try out the expansions pertty good game always entertained when i play it cooperative makes it appealing to those who disdain conflict in games ie girls played more than 5 times my first collaborative game great challenge though can basically be unwinnable if you get unlucky and playing on legendary terrible game rating after 6 2player plays nice quick cooperative game short enough for you to want to give it one more try well designed with good graphics keen to try it with 3 or 4 players to see if it becomes more or less difficult to win you certainly cant waste a single move in the 6epidemic game update jan  12 plays and im done with this it doesnt have the staying power of the lord of the rings coop traded away not overly complex but still requires good team work and tactical considerations i fully agree with the statement that it is probably the best coop board game out there the only flaw of this game is that if you play with smart players you will usually end up agreeing that a single course of action is the best  and end up taking it sometimes you will lose games even if you made no mistakes although the game is randomized by the cards players have only one objective and heavy gamers may find this a little light every introduction is well received a great coop gamethis really introduced me to that whole ideaworking together versus against each other boyfriend owns its not bad but if someone starts quarterbacking its just okay usually the game goes by with people delegatingdiscussing fun with the right group of people sold its nice but no point having too many pandemics and i prefer fall of rome in shrink owned by a friend 25p the problem with this game is there will be some stronger personalities sitting at the table dictating the whole game while others just sit there and watch obeying the masterminds comands solid coop game however could just as well be a solo game usually only one good decision to make so the choices are limited during gameplay you dont really get the winninglosing experience after winninglosing the game just sort of ends at some point you are trying to hold back the inevitable and overwhelming spread of virus and if you manage to complete some tasks meanwhile you win not an enjoyable experience playing this android version 875 this is a great game to play with my wife and 8 and 5 year old sons we all have a good time when we play this one  raised this to a 9 we really have a lot of fun with pandemic we picked up the unofficial threat level six expansion made by the warp here on bgg and the official expansion on the brink adding these in bring a lot of variability to the game and i dont see my enthusiasm for playing it waning anytime soon when you are making a coop game you want it to be challenging thematic and colorful well at least this one comes with a wide variety of difficulty settings its a shame it is so plain and repetitive and while almost all coops have the players competing against a randomness generator here that generator is too dull and predictable and arbitrary to really engage you in the end this game cant really hold up to the storytelling power and intricate game play of something like arkham horror or red november played a good number of times minor shelf where this is the first game i ever played of which i didnt feel the need to buy i like the look of the game and the high quality components but by playing this game i found out that coop is not meant for me when i play a game i would like to win not being part of a bunch that won or lost great scenario immersion but no covid edition  cooperative game with an awesome concept pandemic was a ton of fun and i wish the cooperative genre was more diverse because of it love the final few minutes  ramps up quickly a several plays now quite fun and can be quite challenging best with a group that will discuss strategy and not simply tell new players what to do i am pretty much done playing base pandemic the expansions are still fun and keep things fresh like others this was my first experience with coop games un grand classique des jeux coop jaime beaucoup les m caniques maintenant je ne suis pas fan de lesthetisme un peu froid pandemic was on of the reason for getting a big boardgame fan this game has simple rules but it is not easy to win  and you can make it always harder and harder with special cards or more epidemic cards and people who arent so familiar with games and played pandemic were positive surprised and enjoyed playing for me pandemic is one of the best games ever made and it is definitly the best coopgame on the market i like the artwork i like the few roles i like that every game ist different and a challenge every boardgame collector should own this game good cooperative game played against the board shadows over camelot are a tad better but this is still a good buy they say its a cooperative game i say its a solitary one i dont see how you can play this game with someone else ive tried it and still dont see how unlike other cooperative games like arkham horror where you can do what you want without necessarily losing the game pandemic makes you go and do things you have no freedom well if you do what you want you will lose i also dont see whats the big fuss about this game its shallow and has little replayability its always the same thing over and over again  possibly the most fun i have had against a game where the board almost always wins we played the normal version and were wiped out in around 15 minutes a much more interesting coop game then forbidden island  more robust and more challenging a collaborative game that will help you to engage with others and think as a team  on the brink expansion a quite easy to learn and to play cooperativegame sadly i have to restrain myself not to be an alphaplayer with all the expansions after 50 plays im still not bored with it 7  9 enjoyed the coop feel worked well with two players tempting to let one player take control though  imperial outpost my favorite coop id play this anytime it was suggested also pandemic on the brink played 3 times and finally won on normal with 3 players fun cooperative game and very tense you can end up losing at almost any moment my favorite coop game fairly simple to teach and very funny one should only be aware not to influence his fellow players let people make their own decisions and everybody will have a great time i prefer forbidden desert as its a cleaner version of this game edit i like this more than i originally gave it credit for the legacy games are extremely great but this game is slightly above average as well awesome gateway coop game very overrated mixed reactions from both children and adults not as enjoyable as forbidden islanddesert from which it shares almost the exact same mechanics with nice coop does depend on the luck of the draw but you can mitigate it the world is crumbling viruses are loose its up to the atlanta team to cooperate and eradicate them before they devour the world its a fun game for friends traded it off because someone else bought it at work and its easier to just play the one at work than to tote mine around really fun and good paced weve gotten pretty good at it and can beat it on the hardest level every other game or so x i love this game i love coops i love the theme i love the slight amount of luck that it has great all around game on loan this is one of my 3 top solo games and the quickest to set up and play also taking the least space while i think there is the potential problem in cooperative play of one person taking over for solo play this game is tops see my review for more details adult play  9 kid play  8 my favorite cooperative game good playtime great game hard to go back to this one after playing season 1 of pandemic legacy though this game does become extremely challenging on the highest epidemic setting replayability is god for awhile but will start to feel slightly repetitive sometime feels like one player plays for all the other players this is an excellent cooperative board game not only is it wellbalanced it is also thematically very apt game time is under an hour and that makes it suitable as a family game the artwork is reasonably welldone as well a small concern is the low winning percentage which may turn away some gamers this is especially so if you draw an early epidemic card my significant other and i fortunately do not fall into this category  in the brink great intense coop game  cause i have not played expansion yet cooperative quite good coop game that im just not so fond of for some reason i dont like the theme i suppose also for me it feels more like im moving cubes than stopping a disease from spreading good i enjoy the theme and it makes the game easy to sell to nongamers the puzzleish feel is fun bad i played this with a group of computer scientists like myself and we found that the best moves were fairly easy to spot after that luck plays a significant role i feel like forbidden island streamlines the concepts in this game somewhat fun coop game suffers the same issues as most coop titles amazing cooperative game great cooperative game like many it is possible for one person to take over and be the alpha controlling everything but overall fun engaging and tense not bad for a coop game certainly takes plenty of skill and teamwork and has some innovative and interesting mechanics and rules ultimately im afraid that once a handful of priciples are found the game will turn into a nearly 100 luckfest it is all about priorities chaininfections need to be stopped at all costs next is making sure that all of a given kind of disease cube isnt exhausted once that is under control focusing on curing the diseases the only real way to win is top priority the only real question then becomes if your cure deck will run out before you can cure the 4 diseases that in turn largely depends on luck although low skill will certainly kill you as long as you keep your priorities straight luck will dominiate the outcome if not for it being a rare coop game id rate it a 6 this game has a fantastic cooperative mechanic of having to work together i like sitting down and discussing different ways to cure the diseases with my family it is simple and easy to learn sleeved bought from riw hobbies  amazing game play the good a really good coop game plays just fine solo as well rules are pretty easy to learn and game plays pretty fast a little over an hour all this and you also learn some geography components are very nice this game is also a big challenge to win great tension as you draw cards to see if another outbreak has occurred  the bad my board is warped it may be that the strategy will wear thin after a few games but even if this happens it is so much fun i suspect i would contine playing maybe i need to play more i have only 4 timesbut i was really expecting the next coming of coop gamesmeh it wasnt all there although still goodmy expectations were a tad higher traded away for candamir  the infection is fast and rough i enjoy it highly recommended the cooperative mechanic was a great addition to our collection mechanically speaking its just building card sets but the so and i cant help getting caught up in the theme nice coopertative game easy rules and not very easy to win got the english edition and sold this one at lauam ngud fbgroup genre defining game and worthy of it great fun and the way the ai spreads disease works maddeningly well quite hard to beat classic gateway coop game fun  easy to play brilliant design pandemic is a great coop game although it can lead to a dominant player taking control then again i am a player who likes to play fast and makes stupid mistakes in the process so i loose who cares coop game can be difficult for beginners to win or even experienced players with bad luck very abstract theme is strange and not so catchy as arkham horror or battlestar galactica theme in pandemic is dry but its good way to test cooperative game mechanics to want buy next and better cooperative games as arkham horror update after some losses i won and think yes it would be interesting but after three wins ive got some strange feelengs are there something more to discover in this game or thats all folks from 7 to 6 update from 6 to 3 after few games i found it very boring and not replayable update absolutelly 1 pointd fun but a bit overhyped awesome gamehits the table quite often great game expansions make it more challenging 700j t k this is part of my gateway collection used to introduce family and friends to modern boardgames the benchmark in cooperative games and an ideal introduction to the coop genre the simple premise that all players are a team against the game itself often provides such a different experience of gaming that people are energised when they first play and cant wait to play again themeing is spot on if a little close to the bone in these covid days gameplay is easy enough to pick up though is greatly assisted if someone has played before and the dynamic nature of the puzzle provides a great groupthink challenge the variety of roles and the random nature of the deck provide ample replayability its a sense of team achievement to win when playing at the normal level its proper elation if you succeed against the hardest difficulty just need to be careful that one player doesnt take over and that all of the team have input cooperative with a good selection of roles to get started with theme is apt during our own lockdowns could this be the new gateway game easier to get the cure onto any table anywhere and faster for everyone to agree on reign of cthulhu then original solid coop game to introduce to those who arent fully into board games good game but no point in getting it if you get legacy season 1 interesting cooperative game w fun game mechanics i suspect this woudl play quickly with experienced players cooperative gameplay makes a win a bit less satisfying but is a good team experience ill play it if someone brings it along and wants to play but im in no hurry to quite like the cthulhu version includes on the brink expansion in the base box good fun sometimes tense we managed to get disagreement between players which shows sometimes how difficult cooperative games can be its possible to add extensions new roles or special action cards in the future  top 100 28  top 100 23 excellent game quick to play and im always up for one more mi primer juego cooperativo y un desaf o todav a fast fun extremely well designed co op game smooth as butter though way too easy one of my favourite games tense fastpaced and difficult to beat deserves its good reputation muy buen representante de juego cooperativo ideal como juego en solitario 4 i love it more than my wife does pretty fun and i definitely see the appeal we started with forbidden island but i guess coops just dont work that well with my crowds wife seems to like this one more than fi though ok but very dry finding this less and less fun but still an excellent design a must have can be hard to wrap your head around but once you get used to it youll hate this game in the best way possible its very unforgiving and is a game youll have more fun losing than beating no grupo played with the right group of pushy shovy people this conquest of the common cold can be a real pleasure to try and complete with a incredibly steep difficulty curve this game is worth it just for the challenge     banzgames        fantastic coop really a must own gamers love it nongamers are not intimidated by it tense strategic forces teamwork you will lose enough to have really satisfying victories great gateway my wife hates it though a great cooperative game about trying to save the world and who doesnt love trying to save the world players work together to cure diseases that may eliminate the human race they have to treat disease and work together to find cures before they all die and the world is left a barren wasteland for the chimps to take over no other games i have played are as streamlined and at the same time as nerve wreckingly exciting to play as pandemic it remains the reigning monarch of cooperative games in my opinion a good game i use more for new gamers and a more casual crowd little rules but lots of strategy but easy to learn limiting factor it has the issue with the gamer that tells everyone what to do but the cons are overridden by the pros of the game overall fun satisfying game with the right crowd a great game still i dont mind coops but this experience fell a little flat for me in the game we won it seemed like some of the plays were prescribed and it end up where one player was kind of quaterbacking the plays of the other players maybe the legacy games would be more interesting someday when ive played all the other games ill come back to this great coop game relatively easy to teach and creates lots of tension can suffer from alpha gamer syndrome with the wrong crowd good family game there is a risk of one guy shotcalling the whole match replayability not super high as optimal moves will be done after 10  15 matches which reduces the game to a topdeck gamble i cant stop playing this i own this version and the legacy version and i have to say the legacy version is significantly better in terms of twists and turns and content but the problem with the more awesome legacy version is that it takes at least 15 hours to play in totality so if you get this version i recommend you get the expansions in order to add the features of the legacy but without all the time commitment ive got the 10th anniversary edition my first gateway game and im so happy with my purchase the hard version of forbidden island all it takes is a few bad flips and the game ends right before your eyes once you learn the secret of the game some of its appeal and replay leaves but that took me quite a while i still thoroughly enjoy playing with new people and is a has a special place in my collection frankly stressfull good cooperative game i just dont like cooperative games very good coop game want to get more plays in weight 242 always a favorite at our house excellent cooperative game its mechanics are quite simple and easy to explain but it can be hard to win the pressure the game puts on you forces the group to think and discuss whats the best option every turn especially during the late game i love that kind of interaction between the players which makes pandemic one of my favourite games i always play it with the on the brink expansion which adds more variety and unpredictability to the game great game and can be very difficult i find my inner alpha player coming out constantly when playing this game i try not to do it because it drives my friends crazy but i am so competitive i just want to win kept in pandemic on the brink box the game gets dry after a while once everyone knows what needs to be done do yourself a favor and get the expansion because it gets a hell of a lot better when theres more variety and bigger challenges this one looks interesting first impressions are that im disappointed that the cards seem very inexpensive and since you keep the epidemic cards out while shuffling the whole deck it is easy to tell which cards are epidemics because they are crisp and unused i guess that this is once game where the cards might need to be sleeved looks very hard to win it will be interesting to see the strategies unfold medic seems an especially important role one of the few games my wife is happy to play again though she will give almost any game a try  played several times now and winning almost 50 my wife liked this game a lot when we tried it at a denver games meetup so i picked it up as a birthday present for her the cooperative aspect is unique in my collection and it really complements some gatherings of players great cooperative game love playing this with the family ticks all the marks great theme thinky gameplay scalable difficulty and enough tension in the late game                                      cool coop game this is a nice one i like the coop aspect and that you can alter the difficulty level beginner level is quite easy but on normal it gets more difficult there is a lot of luck involved though and sometimes its very easy to win still its a good game no fun i dont understand the reason why people like this best coop so far quick thematic and tense got pandemic as a birthday present this was my first coop game and i really enjoy the puzzle every time i play this game i later bought the expansion which added a lot more characters to play and additional difficulties as well as the bioterrorist which turns pandemic into an alternative scotland yard prototypical coop game and with a medical theme that is extra suitable for me i really dont know why this one gets its reputation i and my friends all think it is rather boring so ive played it on steam for 8 hrs so far not too bad but still quite boring summer  math trade acquisition nicely designed coop game that can provide some tense moments and agonizing decisions gets a lot of one player tells all the other ones comments but i dont mind because ragging on the one guy who was so sure where to tell everyone to go and then loses is fun the infectionepidemicreshuffling mechanic is brilliant one of a handful of games ive played that when we lose someone says were playing again we almost had it the last time played solo two three and four players played great every time won one of those games that i never really ever suggest playing possibly because its a coop when i do play it though i really enjoy it one word of warning if its played with an experienced player they can sometimes take over the game just telling everybody what to do i suppose thats a possible problem with any coop as someone has never really played boardgames i really enjoy this game being coop theres less pressure as i learnt the game with players who tend to have a more dominate competitive character its easy to learn and fun to play over and over this game is my gateway to the hobby i play this more as a solitair game rather than with a group one of the best coops available theres always something to learn and improve on pro played friends copy took some time to get the mechanics down but it feels like it will play rather fast once everybody gets things down and thus can get repeat plays in a single setting its a very well done coop con winning can be dependent on what roles players are given ill play it if thats whats being played but not really asking to play it rating potential 8 im ok with my rating update last two games really fell flat although that was partly due to an error in the initial shuffling of the cards this is no longer worthy of an 8 i just need to figure out where as a 7 it lays  absolutely love this game i can understand when people say it may get repetitive and definitely encourages the alpha player but this is still one of my favorite games to play with my family and we hardly ever win the complexity can be a little daunting to new players but once you get it the game really starts flowing the theme is amazing as you always feel like you really are fighting a losing fight for the survival of mankind definitely recommend picking up the expansion as well i enjoy pandemic but so far am not really a huge fan of cooperative games as i like the competition and mental battle between human players the player interaction is good if you have the right people but at times the game feels like you are solving a puzzle you could solve alone although the premise is interesting the game plays itself especially when advanced players are in the room plus the 21st century setting with the absurd givetake rules ruins the veneer of reality why can t players trade info because it s a rule not because the rule makes any sense one of the best games in my collection by far the first time my wife and i played it we were hooked its nervewracking and quick paced and such an exciting game it really got me into cooperative games if you havent played it just go buy a copy now just do it i have played this countless times with many people and every single person has asked to play again immediately after we finished the game gets very frustrating when you lose game falls down if one player makes a stupid move which is a detractor this was the first board game i had bought no regrets the most fun great to have been introduced to the hobby i have moved onto legacy but this travels bought the app version great for break at work great game but like a lot of coop games the fun factor depends heavily on who youre playing with great coop game and still finds it way on the table after purchasing it six years ago loads of fun weight 25 plays best with 24 players  on the brink  in the lab  state of emergency fantastic game the standard bearer for cooperative games the only struggle is replayability slowly dwindles over time as players learn the most effective strategies i really like the way this game looks and works the idea of it did not interest me until i had seen so many good comments about it so i wanted to try at first i thought i liked it not because its a great game but because its addictive in the just one more time kind of way now i think its just a very tight design that works wonderfully its short enough and frustrating enough when you barely lose that i wonder if its pandering to that instinct to make me play more until i beat it bumped the rating up after several plays not sure im a cooperative player either that or ive only played with people who make it unenjoyable i should probably give it a few more tries found it on sale on amazon for 25 and since my four boys ages  and i enjoy playing games i figured it was worth a shot one of the best game investments ive ever made no question  to the point that when i found pandemic on the brink on sale i purchased it for the point in time when were ready to expand my 13 yearold is very particular about what games he likes to play so hes usually my litmus test the only one who didnt like it was my 16 yearold but hes at the age of not wanting to spend time with me anyway so i take that with a grain of salt  the first game took about an hour as we figured out the dynamics and game play needless to say the outcome was not in our favor  despite an early eradication we quickly lost ground after that we were able to sort through the best way to leverage the various roles strengths this is one of the few games that even after a rocky start my boys kept asking me to play  that is a win the only downside thus far and its a stretch is that role combination can swing things pretty substantially but its a small downside and if anything makes it more challenging i originally rated this game 8 but bumped it up to 9 after playing with a different group the right people ie people who really get it and get into it make this game tons of fun love playing this coop game very refreshing to compete against the game instead of against your friends fun roles that leave attacking the game differently each time a must have for anyones collection very clever a good cooperative game sometimes feels like your actions does not matter so i give it less points for that reason otherwise a great game great game my group that doesnt like complex games loves it still a challenge to win 4p this is the game that really got me hooked on board games just the most awesome game add the in the lab expansion and unbelievably it gets awesomer yes thats a word a great coop game ive always played it two player but imagine it would be even harder and better with more a very clever mechanic and genuinely exciting near the end update  have played it multiple times with 3 4 and 5 and it just seems to get harder great game best cooperative gameif you count as well its variants legacys etc great cooperative game that really challenges the players often up to the last several turns seems to be ground zero for modern cooperative games solid rules and an innovative theme captures first time players most really enjoy it watch out for the bossy types they can take over more timid personalities it does lose some appeal after a while and feels more like a puzzle sodont play it too often and enjoy for years to come got rid of this and got flash point instead i generally prefer flash point although they are very similar i folie i enjoy competitive games over cooperative but ill play pandemic if its requested this game is definitely more enjoyable when the difficulty level is raised appropriately i prefer crushing defeat over easy victory any day of the week storaged typically when i propose this game i ask anyone here want to save the world what youre going to say no now chances are you wont save the worldthe difficulty here is stiff but its a lot of fun trying pretty much as good as cooperative board gaming gets  still good but it brings out the manager in me this is the granddaddy of modern cooperative games the game that largely set the formula for other modern cooperative games its the perfect gateway game for new strategy andor cooperative gamers i have played it a lot and really loved it that said i only give it an 8 because many newer cooperative games building on the pandemic formula have added more depth ill probably never play the original pandemic again except when introducing new gamers to cooperative games but i nonetheless find it one of the most fun experiences i have had in gaming starting to loose its luster easy game to teach others but every game seems to go the same plus the alpha person or more experienced person seems to run the ship causing an experience with very little real interaction playing against the system just isnt for me i think i have similar feelings towards arkham id rather play agricola ttr or tikal to name a few over this one still not a bad game but not as great as i expected like it want to play with the expansion no laughs plenty of groans though and the occasional yes good to play with new people go to cooperative game the varying difficulty levels make this great for anyone 24 players best with 4 45 minutes pandemic is a great game and one of the milestones of the hobby i dont love coops but when i play one its usually between marvel legendary and pandemic in the lab on the brink state of emergency this is an amazing game great for communicating and planing i loved it this is a mediumweight cooperative game where you race around the globe trying to contain and cure virus outbreaks be strategic and find a cure great to have a coop that plays well another favorite of my wife  she particularly likes the coop aspect of the game i brought this game as a casual gateway game for friends and family i dont think this game is good for that purpose however as all the times ive tried this with friends and family not into board games i found they mostly let me make all the decisions its also pretty hard even on the easiest difficulty that said as a coop experience this game is good with more experienced board gamers the fun often comes from the discussions of plans as you try and eliminate the viruses before they go pandemic with the right group of people the discussions over game plans who needs to be where and when to use the character abilities is where this game is at its best the game can get repetitive over multiple sessions but i imagine the various expansions probably help with this i only own the base game however so cant comment on the expansions its overall a solid coop game but definitely not a gateway game for more experienced board gamers only simple rules nasty viruses i like that this game gives the players a genuine sense of urgency and menace working together isnt only essential but also fun this is the best cooperative game ive played so far great coop can teach to nongamers really easily theme is easy to get into for everyone i have played with so far what a great design always a challenge sold whats not to love this game is a perfect entry level game as well as one more experienced gamers can love for years to come this game changed my gaming world and now i own all the expansions plus legacy and even bought the original game and on the brink expansion to have in my collection very good game forbidden island on steroids lots of fun and easy to have a great time with almost any group of people and its just hard enough that you always feel as if the viruses are going to conquer you cooperative game where every player has a unique character with unique capabilities that have to work together really together almost no mistake is allowed in order to defeat the spreading of illness the game is easy to explain the idea is very good i think that the mechanics are may be too general and can be applied to other games forbidden island for instant very similar but the game is fun to play the biggest issue that i have is that for me this game is in reality a solitaire game the complexity is so high that in the end one player has to control almost everything in order to succeed positive 1 high complexity when you win there is a real feeling of victory 2 easy to explain 3 the actions are easy the difficulty lies in how to combine them 4 quick to play and quick set up negative 1 more suitable for 1 player 2 the best version for me is the digital one tablet i enjoy the cooperative mechanic of the game everyone work as a team to beat the game the game presents challenges with each different combination of role cards drawn and each game feels different in addition it is a relatively short less than an hour for 2 person game soldandre not a good game for control freaks like me daughter will end up never wanting to play with you again good cooperative game to rebuild goodwill with guests after having destroyed their selfesteem in other games the same evening up to 4   solo  this is my revised comments on pandemic the coop genre has changed quite a bit over the year if there is one place that i would recommend someone to start its here pandemic is probably one of the best games for couples out there being a coop as regular life with a significant other can sometimes be confrontational enough as it is without adding take thatcompetitive games to heat things up in addition to that this game is very easy to learn and not overly long which makes it a perfect gateway game coops of the modern day need a way to scale the difficulty levels and pandemic is one of the best in this regard i had initially rated this game a 6 because it lacked the variety to hold my interest and while i still feel this way about the base game on the brink has transformed the game to something much more enjoyable and variable in addition to that after having played some other coops i have a much deeper appreciation for the game even in its base form though i would never play without the extra rolesevents of on the brink i would rate this higher with the inclusion of at least one expansion if youre not going to invest in an expansion youre better off with buying pandemic iberia 7 roles 15 events and included variants breakdown see expansion for their breakdowns 7 roles 5 in the old editions 5 events normal challenge  decoding plays e  how many epidemics we used v  virulent m  mutation b  bioterrorist l  lab p  worldwide panic t  team game y  emergency events h  hinterlands q  quarantines s  superbug i was initially wary of pandemic due to overbearing players playing my turn but provided there is noone doing this the game is actually very fun i love the simple rules and coop play i do feel that some of the roles are a little more adventageous to play one of those that no matter what you do you always feel like you are behind built in tension love it a classic coop game one play with four dunno the mechanics are interesting and the game was notunfun but it is really multiplayer solitaire in the truest sense of the word  everyone working to beat the game before it beats you meh we won but there was no overwhelming feeling of accomplishment no ooh remember when or i was planning this but  moments it passed the time in an unboring way but really not much more than that finally got my own copy after playing others for years my first cooperative game loving the concept both this is really the best coop game to get ppl to play hands down one of my favorite games to introduce nongamers into the world of boardgames it is a perfect them for a cooperative game the kids really enjoyed it first time i was really looking forward to this one played it twice in essen  to be sure that i do not like it the gameplay feels oddly relaxing for the unnerving theme would play this any time painted pieces by david short 24 4 acquired  lost in fireaug18 have the original version otherwise id have added an expansion by now to refresh the game  good insert organizational system good light co op   my family only recently discovered pandemic but wow was it a hit aside from our zendo variant weve played no other cooperative games my younger son was not very interested at first but as the tension started to ratchet up he grew more and more excited there were highfives all around when we won our first game good fun when i first got into board gaming and started my collection i preferred cooperative games pandemic was one of my favorites i no longer own this game but recently ive been thinking of getting it back in my collection this game is a classic for all the right reasons great theme interesting mechanics meaningful special powers and a variety of choices that impact the outcome of the game as with most cooperative games pandemic can easily suffer from a single player bossing everyone around at the table i prefer to play cooperatives with groups that allow everyone to take their own turn if we lose we lose when i think of pandemic i think that its the perfect game its a coop and it brings people together to complete the noblest of tasks save the world population from extinction by disease it does it in such a great way where mechanics and theme come together seamlessly to immerse players in the narrative in pandemic players take on various roles each with its own unique powers using these powers wisely in conjunction with other players roles is the the best chance you have to win the game on a players turn they will move around the board which is a global map they will try to treat diseased populations build research facilities where cures can be found gather cards to be used for curing disease and then actually cure those diseases watch out though every turn more cities become infected with one of four deadly viruses which are colour coded to win players must cure all four diseases however there are many ways to lose if any one disease has gotten so out of control that there are no more cubes left in its colour players lose players will also lose if there are too many outbreaks triggered finally if the draw deck runs out before all four diseases are cured that also counts as a loss for the players pandemic is tense right from the beginning and it only gets worse as the game progresses youre immediately thinking how can we possibly put out all these fires all over the globe it will take teamwork skill and luck to save the world from the pandemic favorite cooperative game good twoplayer difficulty really increases with more players only complaint is length of game wish it was just as tense but shorter play time i like the theme a lot and it is reflected well in the gameplay the game is really quite difficult to win though our first game 2 player on the easy difficulty found us able to cure only 2 of the 4 colors but the whole time it was obvious that we were going to get wiped out before we could wintough draw my rating for this has crept down over the years although thats mostly due to advancements in gaming as this base version is still a good game the one flaw if you want to call it that is that its a coop game that can be played more efficiently by a single player playing multihanded so as long as the table doesnt fall into that situation which can be tempting when you feel the game system take the upper hand it holds up one of the great coops i dont have the big desire to play because its prone to alpha gamer syndrome but it is a great challenge play with on the brink for greater challenge one of my wifes favorite very intense but rewarding artwork is a little too s for me can be frustrating depending on difficulty an excellent cooperative nonetheless diseases spread when you less expect it great cooperative game family loves it cool game not my favorite gave the game to our cousins i have the app one of the most refreshingly different 2 player games you could ever play with nonbggs where are my empty medicine bottlesthats such a cool idea added tuckboxes at the start 6 epidemics are difficult with 2 players but after many plays it almost becomes easy replayability for 2 players is offset by player experience and luck the expansion variants correct this by trading luck for the desired effect this game is politically correct fantastic game tense thematic and a joy to play depending on your luck it can be easy to win or hard to win probably the best 100 coop game that ive played so far played 4x as of  great coop game that keeps you coming back for more the games ive played have not had a problem with one person directing the others yet ive found it acceptable but not an amazing game fun but can easily burn me out and then i dont want to play for a while played a couple of times before returning concept is brilliant but the theme and gameplay can be somewhat dry quarterbacking was the biggest problem if you think you you get immerse yourself in the theme and play with folks who are willing to make their own decisions then pick it up if not i would pass pandemic is a game that everybody should try it defined the coop niche of board games although it was not first by offering a well balanced game where you could choose difficulty level you really feel like a team trying to solve the worlds crises and thus it is a perfect couple game theres a lot of table talk going on the different roles and the randomness of the diseases and epidemics make every game a unique experience the expansion on the brink makes a perfect game even better though it is important to note that the game can suffer from a passive player syndrome sometimes you play with people who are not interested in team work or even talking to each other its those whod prefer computer games instead they can ruin a whole evening because the whole team really need to sync and cooperate to function and succeed with reaching their goals they will not response when you are trying to discuss your own moves and when you discuss their moves they will become threatened and defensive dont play pandemic with these people lot of fun enjoyed this one rating goes up every time we play this game lowered rating we have started to win this way to much added expansions to make it more difficult need to play more with in the lab and on the brink amazon there are not enough stars for pandemic and all of its expansions this feels almost more like a cooperative puzzle than a game a lot of the fun is figuring out how the game systems work and trying to delay the losing conditions just long enough to meet the win condition its hard to play just once especially if you lose since every loss feels like oh we just had to do two more actions and we would have won the expansions add a lot to this game and i love how modular they are pure coop games are at risk of going stale as you figure out how to play the system effectively but you can always add a different mix of the many expansion modules and you have a slightly new spin on the basic game to think about enjoy playing it but doesnt seem to come on the table too often probably because of the type a family  tacticsstrategy 5 thematic ties 4 ease of play 5 aesthetics 4 components 3 replayability 4 game length 5 player scale 5 preference 8 total 86 notes great cooperative game that feels more thematic than it should a travel size yet deep game alpha gaming can ruin the experience the suspense in this game is amazing especially in my first couple of plays ive never had a game do this before also my first ever cooperative game and i find that i do really enjoy the genre one of the lightest coop games out there but here light is good and the game is not less interesting because of that brutally difficult and often seems too luckbased but lots of fun with a group nice coop to wind down after a particularly competitive game i really wish i liked this game but i find it far too stressful to be enjoyable great gateway game but a format that i feel has been improved upon by games like black orchestra wooden pieces first edition great great game we havent beaten it yet after 4 plays but we have come sooooo close incredible coop for the family always play with on the brink great fun for iris and me classic game feel but due to the cooperative colour of the game highly refreshing very good coop game that is not at all easy to win  which adds to replayability i m infected ok very solid cooperative game with a theme that makes players really want to not lose always seems within reach but often tense to the end electronic version this is the board game that ignited my passion for the next level of board games i enjoy the cooperative aspect very much this game also was my first experience with a game in which you were not expected to win every time you playand i loved it it is challenging yet rewarding the difficulty can be adjusted and rules are fairly straightforward after playing 12 times the speed of the game is determined by experience of the players or by poor decisions really good coop game it is recommended to couple this with on the brink expansion very impressive cooperative game a set collection game at its heart the only way to win is to complete a set of each of the four colours  however one player must have all five or four cards in their hand at the time must be at a research station and must use an action to cure that disease complicated by several builtin timing mechanisms  if the card deck runs out if all of one colours cubes are exhausted if eight outbreaks have occurred  the game is over the game appears to be more difficult with more players and the different combinations of player roles can change the dynamics of game play considerably zman has done an excellent job with graphic design and production with one caveat  the player pawns are far bigger than they need to be a slight quibble for an outstanding game experience i play this base game mostly solo wife not interested i love it though my wifes favorite coop the on the brink expansion has breathed new life into this game great coop game that is very easy to learn and quick to play as long as debating doesnt get too heated the main problem i have with it is that depending on how the deck is stacked the game varies greatly in difficulty in an unintentional way ive had cakewalk games and then there are games in which you dont stand a chance if you are playing with new people to the game the latter results in a very sour taste in their mouth currently have the on the brink and state of emergency expansions i always mix parts of them in to spice it up j  tem review no ddt interesting coop game pretty hard it seems unless you are really coordinated between the various characters you have to optimize your use of their special abilities also seems extremely difficult if you dont have the medic playing with open hands is smoother and better since all the information is out there anyways  ie theres no information youre required to keep secret still it doesnt grab me that much but i wouldnt refuse to play most of the time boring austria played once and enjoyed thoroughly this really does belong in everyone s collection nice production tight mechanics great design from its box to it s components to it s table and shelf footprint bought for family coop gaming nice tension puzzling hopefully hits the table often as we retire lighter fare such as outfoxed and ghost fighting treasure hunters update wife is now addicted so 100 for gateway factor update actual discussion about getting legacy season 1 este jogo tem que estar na vossa cole o quer com adultos quer com crian as aprendese com facilidade e faz logo sucesso no grupo em que   jogado   um jogo cooperativo que d  luta aos jogadores com possibilidade de escolher o grau de dificuldade recomendo vivamente   401 games nov  its pandemic thats enough simple challenging and cooperative game quick and simple best with 34 players nice game seems to be kind of a bench mark for other coop games on s difficulty can be tuned with amount of used epidemic cards which is great feature otherwise this could start to be boring after some games not much of a variation between the games later editions with couple of new characters help a bit i like to play this but truly enjoyable gaming session sets some requirements for the group ability to discuss and plan together with constructive and polite manners willing to focus on game and so on its faster to play and less complex to teach for new players than eg arkham horror my true coop favourite which makes it usually the first choice option when our group wants to play coop game second edition pandemic is a big improvement however the expansions especially in the lab drastically improve this game every role card and scenario adds more variation this really is the coop among coops and i highly recommend it however the first edition is still fine and perfectly enjoyable just try not to be a dominating alpha gamer  of players 2   4 user suggested  of players best with 4 players recommended with 1 2 3 4 players 708 voters fun coop game that my gaming group loves the expansion on the brink would be good addition to the collection this is a fun entry level game you can always bring out with friends but youre limited to only 4 players one of the best coop games available i always love to play it i played this game with my wife and some friends its cooperative nature was not appealing to any of us if you like cooperative games this may be worth a shot however i strongly recommend that you try it before you buy it an early edition one with the large wood research stations in very goodnear mint condition since the cards were sleeved while it was in use stupid pandemic stupid cubes alpha player the game plays you first coop game ive picked up fun but feel there should be something much more fun to fill that gap in my collection edit lowered rating one becomes less and less fun each playthrough too much guiding of other players by someone strategizing making it almost feel like a one player game yet to win a game but gots to love the challenge dont really know what we are doing wrong or is this just a brutal joke from the designers part to keep me in the sick game of his cause if there is something that i cant solve or comprehend in a few gos ill stay posted on it until i succeed god damn it if you do not already own pandemic save yourself some money and waste by buying yourself pandemic legacy season 1 instead once you are through with the legacy campaign you can remove all the stickers from the board and cards throw away the strictly legacy stuff and youre left with a perfectly good version of vanilla pandemic i sold my original copy of pandemic long ago but i had family who loved it so i now own it again in the form of our completed season 1 its grown on me played it nothing special pretty straightforward and dull just brilliantgreat gateway impending doom feel is awesome only complaint is that new players may feel like theyre not involved when playing with experienced players this is not a game i generally suggest playing however it s always a great experience especially if everything comes together i feel there is a luck element with relation to cards in your hand and with respect to what  specialist  characters you draw great puzzle though one of the 1st modern games i played and still love however the iberia version and malaise after playing legacy s1 meant it wasnt going to hit the table again cooperativo bueno cumple se quema r pido con la expa se le alarga la vida y mejora mucho con las variantes recomendable juntos an excellent game easy to play and very intense in its suspense i really like dd it falls back a little if the team doesnt like it rating based on two initial plays so im sure its bound to go down from there as i generally dont care for coop games this one feels more fresh because of the roleinteractions and the foreknowledge of where the diseases where strike the deck can hose you but not to the degree that a game like lotrings can because you have ways to contain the badness instead of just seeing what pops out of the bag a great co op game the expansion made it better i think solid coop game with a nice theme the game sadly suffers a lot from the fact at least with everybody i played with that a more experienced even one game vs zero player either has to keep silent or tell everyone else what to do  this is my major gripe with this game because most of the time there is a clear best turn for whatever strategy you are following and at the end of the day it feels like one or two people play a game and the others are just there to execute orders since all information is open i do not get the feeling that there are real options as 90 of time there is a clear best course of action initial play out of the way wife seemed to enjoy all though we both agree it is way too easy currently blaming that on the initial novice setup so the rating will probably increase as we play more difficult setups english first edition zman another game that got a rare 7 rating from me after one play actually after 3 plays because we played it three times the first time i played it update after those first 3 plays it took over a year to play again the 4th game was in may  once people started bringing it to cabs and then cabs got its own copy it became a dime 10 plays in  update several years later ive now played it a lot and i have my own copy i still like it a lot but it does seem to be more susceptible to one player dominates the game than other cooperative games especially when you play with open cards as we do but if you have closed hands players are still allowed to talk about them so it slows the game way down as people talk about their hands to excess its best with new players who dont mind a little coaching or players of roughly equal experience who arent afraid to give as good as they get first game like the theme a lot won with scientist and researcher a very good combo for beginners several games down the line and still not getting a 10 because little wooden cubes are boring and the cure stations are just little wooden house shape that havent been even painted the game is relatively cheap around 30 but still these days games should come up with better playing pieces than wooden cubes difficulty not a major issue play at easy level with 4 epidemics slowly increase to 5 and 6 otherwise love all of it 1st edition received as a wedding gift  its not among my most favorite of coops but i do enjoy a good game of it here and there the favorite game of my daughter at the moment she is eight years old we play cards open and discuss our strategy anytime it is fun saving te world together  we beat 5 epidemics 15 we love this cooperative game since pandemic so many additional great cooperative games have arisen  and all are subsequently compared to this stalwart game you can see our threadfull family video review of pandemic herethread this is my first coop game i have not found a person that dislikes this game yet easy to learn base game 8 with expansion 85 great coop game hard as heck weve got to find that monkey best cooperative board game ive played very accessible but with just the right amount of difficulty to keep the interest of experienced gamers still in austria michis place it took 4 games for me to get the rules right and i can see this being much more fun in the future i can see this getting alot of plays one of the best coop games ive played ho hum repetitive awesome the first coop board game i think i ever played can fall victim to quarterbacking but with the right group its a good time my first coop game and still my favorite its a great coop puzzler that gives me a little anxiety when things get out of control find four cures before time runs out fun cooperative game that really tests your skills at cooperation and planning received this along with forbidden desert from boardgamegeeks secret santa  tzahi own the best coaprative game great job matt leacock i dont usually give high rating such 78 to boardgames the stunning map all the ways that you could loose all the discussion you make while playing the price tag and the moment you win it you just have the greatest feeling are all the reason i give it 78 but the reasons i give it 78 which is still excellent is because of that when you become an expert at it you tell everyone else what to do taking out the enjoyment of the game for others you always win when you are an expert at it but thanks again to matt leacock he made two great expansions the lab which solves the always winning problem by making you not to radicate and of the deadly viruses immediately on the brink makes the expert in the game to play against all the others which no longer makes it boring for the others because the expert no longer tells them what to do i love those to expansion because of how the solve the problemsthe only epansions i have ever seen that solves a boardgame problem but here we are rating the boardgame not the expansions that is why i give it 78 with the expansions i would give it 84 this is a great cooperational game i rate it as an 8 only for the replayability factor its a game i would play only 56 times a year each time i play this game i like it more and more there are certainly combinations of roles that make the game easier but even with a best case scenario in terms of roles things can blow up very fast if you have an outbreak chain reaction simple and fun a must play for people wanting the next step past gateway games catan munchkin etc its a challenging coop game that forces players to combine their unique player ability with smart actionselection to overcome the sometimes overwhelming odds in our first 3 plays my roommate and i were crushed we got close but couldnt quite keep the diseases under control then on the 4th try we easily crushed the game the epidemic cards were wellspaced in the deck we got lucky roberts easy to learn but tough to win taking risks and cooperating is the key but no guarantee for a win  expansions on the brink in the lab state of emergency  ipad excellent game the one issue is that as a cooperative game its prone to one person playing the leader but i guess that comes with the territory expansions are generally good and add replay value as well but arent necessary good with 24 players though ive personally found it easiest with 2 tense game and great fun were not fans of cooperative games shadows over camelot disappointed but this is excellent and playable in 34s of an hour or less if you mess up makes me appreciate how good hanabi is mediumlight gateway game  coop set collection preeminent coop game very random in the second game we were doing everything right but got wiped out by several successive epidemics we lost the first game too reminiscent of shadows over camelot but shadows is more interesting and gives one more ways to play and win pandemic seems to be a hit with just about everyone we play with it is quite hard at the medium difficulty and we have not yet tried it on hard still we find that a loss often means we will play again in the hopes that we will win this game is well infectious actually the  version but bgg wont add that to my list pandemic in its original form has a quarterbacking issue and on top of that the mechanics are simple enough to solve that it really does just come down to whether youve shuffled the deck into a winning configuration see also solitaire a lot of the recent expansions look like theyve added new mechanics and increased the difficulty of the disease to compensate or maybe its the other way around but honestly i think the core is so weak that im not really willing to find out if the rest is better great coop that ive played a few 2player games of when were losing i love the adrenaline filled futility of the situation as more and more cities start to outbreak great coop game to play reviewed fun coop i seem to lose more often then win at the very last second but i like that im games fun and easy to grasp cooperative game that doesnt outlast its welcome can be played in under an hour useful in teaching children about geography and world cities first game i loved since getting into these newer games always gonna be a fav i dont like follow another player order i am not in love with this as everyone else it it tightly designed and exciting but it feels just a bit coldly perfect i am glad it exists but i would usually prefer to play something else with a bit more personality mustbuy good stepping stone into more heavy boardgames ive beaten this on normal a few times and ive beaten it on six epidemics once this was a complete fluke though i really enjoy this game and i recently got the on the brink expansion and have been enjoying that also good condition and includes on the brink expansion very good coop game each actions must be thought carefully on some scenario youll have to risk also a very variable game  no games will be the same a must try love this game this was that gateway game that turned the corner for me into modern board gaming more so than catanthe quintessential coop king of the co op games a modern day classic we like the lab expansion the most because it adds lots of theme on an already thematic game plus the plastic vials it comes with are great the infect and epidemic mechanisms are pure genius highly recommend to all gamer levels good condition havent played it in a very long time should try it again by far the gfs favorite asks to play it fits in perfectly with her logisticians frame of mind we won our first sixcard game the other day pandemic buy 1 prize table grab i enjoy cooperatives but this one can be frustrating sometimes it feels like there wouldnt be a way to not lose to the board 24 players 12 hours ron jodway i really like the mechanics i have this game i like playing but i think i like race to the galaxy better great game to introduce someone to cooperative play the theme interacts with the mechanics excellently  the way epidemics and outbreaks occur feels like a disease spreading which not only keeps players engaged but also makes it easier to understand and react to if i had never played the expansion i may have rated this game higher the lack of game modes and relative lack of role cards really hurts it by comparison however i find that after playing the base game a few times in a row everything starts to feel samey for lack of a better word every one reaches the same conclusions about strategy because there are only a few differences each time its only possible to gain and lose one role and there are no challenges  2nd hand 60 nis my first coop band friends like it cousins like it have not yet had anyone rise up and be dictator in any of my plays the card hiding mechanic helps with that wish there was a little more variability in the way the game unfolds cooperative players race to treat the disease before it takes over received as christmas gift from clinton and laurel nice cooperative game seemed too easy but we were playing with only 4 epidemic cards need to try again with 5 cards stressful challenging fun tough game to to win especially with 3 players a good adult  kids game as everyone can play at full tilt and is short and structured enough to retain the young uns attention my only coop and a very good one solid game but a win is moderately difficult achieving without an airtight understanding of the rules and maximizing everything leading to losses due to failure of 100 meta game working could be tighter with expansion not sure yet but core concept is strong enough to justify it being in the collection 2 to 4 players uno de los juegos preferidos de mi novia pero siento que a veces se hace demasiado simplesin reto para los que probamos varios juegosdicen que la expansion le ayuda a darle mayor profundidad played once so far excellent fun coop game i like it better than lord of the rings because its shorter which fits my life at the moment great geography lesson too the best coop game i know of this game is a classic great fully cooperative game thats easy to learn and approachable it is a puzzle game that gets easier over plays but allows scaling up difficulty to maintain the challenge expect to lose until you get a hang of it  losing as a teamessens the burn somewhat having so many ways to lose also keeps things interesting randomness is used very well in this game for initial set up and which cities are affected by epidemic cards do have to be careful of alpha gamer factor ie the person who has played it the most telling everyone what to do  have to be mindful to let others make their own mistakes and let them know they can ask advice if needed what i love about this game is its as great at 2 3 or 4 at 2 can always control two characters without any difficulty 4 is a more difficult game as its harder to get a cure on the brink is a completely necessary expansion if you enjoy this one the legacy variants are also well worth delving into once youre familiar with the mechanics the first few plays were amazing and is what really pushed me into the deep end of this hobby  it broke my no games over 40 rule which lasted like a month however i quickly fell more and more out of love with it after each play nowadays it would take a lot of convincing to get me to play the original pandemic ever again now that ive played pandemic the cure and im partway into pandemic legacy season 1 pl bardzo dobra optymalizacyjnokooperacyjna gra planszowa   wietny mechanizm

elegant mechanics the theme is very well represented what a fun game technically i bought this for my brother so he owns it but we play it all the time my fatherinlaw loves this game so we are getting it for him for christmas as well as the expansion glad to see a fifth player can participate now a fairly decent game although its replay value is questionable probably my favorite coop to date interesting puzzle but it is too much prone to alphaplaying game mechanics support alpha players in my opinion fantastic coop game great coop game that is easy to teach to just about anyone plays in a reasonable time and can be really nasty flexible difficulty keeps it fresh need the expansion now this is rapidly rising to become my most logged game  its only been in the house for a couple weeks and already 25 plays of those 25 i think only 6 or 7 are wins after reading some reviews and comments ive realized that were just not planning ahead enough into the future this is a game of intricate logistics one of my best loved coop games pandemic is an awesome game and one everyone should own you really have to work together with your team in order to be successful ive played this solo all the way up to with 4 and its been enjoyable every time the only two nitpicky things i have to say are to be aware of not letting a player hijack the other players turns and i wish the game was a little more tense toward the end great challenge and a great game classic coop no real complaint about anything coops are one of my least favorite game genres but if i am going to play one pandemic would be my first choice ios sold  one of the coop games pioneers with difficulty leveling based on number of epidemics still find this game very fun although its not one i would play every day or even weekly but great when it hits the table every few months or so sold due to the acquisition of pandemic legacy season 1 we finally figured out how to get the most out of the dispatcher and managed to win a game  two players four epidemics on to new worlds  well five epidemics anyway  to conquer update on about the dozenth try two players researcher and containment specialist at last cure six epidemics could a game be more relevant in  only one bad experience in over 20 games and that was when i was trying to teach it to a new group of gamers and within the first two turns we had continuous outbreaks that meant we lost the game the only time its ever happened  ive never been able to play it with them since on the whole very enjoyable and at times very tense amazing good but needs expansions for longevity my first coop game and still my favourite frustrating stressful pissed us off however its worth it update played the survival version at geekway to the west  my wife and i got eliminated first due to us not paying attention to the yellow cubes having played the pandemic system including legacy nearly 40 times now im never excited to reach for vanilla pandemic anymore im just not that interested in the puzzlesolving underlying the game as a whole especially when its hard to know when youve really won or lost due to the randomness of the system to play truly well you have to be more committed to solving the puzzle than i typically am pandemic legacy did a great job of using the underlying system to drive an experience but when youre back to the original it feels too much like an exercise as a result i had pandemic at a 4 for a while but a couple aspects of the game are bringing it back onto my radar first it remains as solid a gateway game as ever we probably prefer through the desert but that game isnt quite as eyeopening as pandemics interactive cooperative nature its fun seeing others get excited about saving the world and puzzling their way through their turns the way we did when we were first starting out second the underlying system has proven to be remarkably customizable which opens up not more variety through expansions but also opportunities for my own design tweaks this is an advantage pandemic has over its simpler siblings like forbidden desert or variants like pandemic realm of cthulhu ive started urlhttpmulrahdroppagescomcustomizationpandemicthinking through some of these possibilities elsewhereurl and if i really get into any of them the rating here could actually go up but for now a 6 seems fair were fine with this as an introduction to the hobby but arent going to be busting it out all that often beyond that a great coop game that many new players underestimate on their first play through its amazing how on a single turn the whole game can get out of hand and have all players scrambling to contain outbreaks pretty easy to learn very good gamea classic the originality and theme of this game is awesome it accurately captures the feel of a disease outbreak that threatens the whole world my friends and i always enjoy playing this game and the tension involved makes this a mustplay for every board game session buy it you wont regret it perfect gateway game people are dumbfounded when you say youre playing a game but that everyones on the same team ive taught it to everyone i know so im a little tired of it but that was after 40 games in about two weeks cant wait for the expansion my desert island game if i could play just one more game in my life it would be this amazing coop i play it or any of its other iterations often with my wife solid and quick cooperative game a good situation for the team can get out of hand rapidly which adds to the tension as you watch threats grow or things just slip out of your grasp i loved pandemic my girls liked pandemic we played pandemic frequently i dont know why but pandemic legacy seems to have killed our appetite for pandemic havent played it since looking forward to pandemic legacy season two i like how it scales from beginner to heroic showing just what huge havoc little tweaks in game rules can make nice coop well designed and balanced easy rules easy setup a lot of fun during playing  better than forbidden island simply the best gatewaycooperative game ive played to date i traded my first copy away for the  berplay edition of thing12thing then played a friends copy recently and simply had to reacquire it only for it to sit in shrink for two years before selling it again a lot of work has gone into the design of the game making each game a close battle against the spreading diseases  theme really works gameplay really works if youre at all interested in coop games a musttry amazing game my wife and i love to play it even though we lose a lot to the diseases a fun and complex puzzle but not a game who would have thought a cooperative game could be so much fun and replayable vier krankheiten breiten sich auf der welt rapide aus es ist eure aufgabe zusammen die drohenden epidemien in schach zu halten und so schnell wie m glich deren heilmittel zu erforschen die welt wei  es noch nicht aber sie steht kurz vor dem untergang  35 mathandel odkrycia dzienniki lewisa i clarka im pretty mehn on this game it just seems too simple for a cooperative game one of the best games i bought in  the brilliant pandemic shines above most of them all where to get the cure for the blue disease  in the lab on the brink  state of emergency interesting but coop is definitely an acquired taste limited replayability but something that is good to bring out for nongamers sold id rate a 2 or so for the multiplayer version as it could also be called alpha gamer the game as i dont mind the solo experience every now and then i think  the latest my rating is for the solo experience only ggg cooperative one of those rear games that you want to play again right after you play it basically spent my time doing whatever the alpha players said to do would play some more just to see if it gets any better but would rather play lots of other games this game was an 8 out of ten for me until i played with the lab challenge in the lab exp the whole game i was engaged and really immersed in the theme that the lab challenge brought out amazing must play with contagion or the international soundtrack in the background coop game thats good for nongamers especially those that dont like games unless they win  on the brink 100 top 50 a really well thought out cooperative game with plenty of tension however there is normally only really one right decision in any situation making much of the group play element redundant once you know what youre doing also the end game mechanic you win by finding all 4 cures not by actually curing the diseases leaves you a bit cold 3 sep  nice tension build up great coop game         we played a lot of pandemic and we really enjoy the theme and game mechanics high variability make it so you might lose at any time and it adds a lot of excitement playing the game i think expansion are needed to really make the game long lived as they help make every game feels different and really challenging this was the first modern board game i bought and my wife and i really enjoy it it doesnt get played that often but whenever we do play it i always end up thinking this is a really good game we have also played it with both sets of nongamer parents and it went over really well when we set it up for my motherinlaw she said i dont think i like this kind of game however after we finished and lost our first game she said ok i get it now lets play again i am not a big fan of pandemic the game is boring to me and most the time my group will always come out with a win easily i like coop games a lot but this one i just have never been a fan of quality game excellent rule book  the rules are uncomplicated and straight forward played the novice game with 4 we came within a turn of winning but lost to the board game play intriguing and want to play again soon the theme of the game is pertinent to the play and mechanics of the game no score you either as a group win or lose the classic cooperative a bit dry for me personally but a good introduction to the genera de los mejores juegos cooperativos que he jugado a diferencia de el eldritch horror que me encanta este es mas corto y por ende ideal cuando hay menos tiempo  juegos jugados  juegos jugados goo due a  sara goo one of the most finely tuned coop board game ive ever played the epidemic mechanic is pure evil brilliance when i was reading the rules alone i still couldnt help but exclaim on top when i read the epidemic mechanic i eventually got rid of it it was just so meh kinda sick of seeing 90 of the game end because the player deck runs out and after playing pandemic legacy going back to this seems pointless the game is so easy to teach and play it is tense and animated i like the outbreak mechanic i also like how each combination of characters abilities make the game ever green you can tweak the difficulty to your liking on the downside 1 sometimes it can feel like cleaning the board of little glass cubes rather than eradicating diseases 2 i dont really understand how collecting city cards help you cure a disease from a thematic stand point 3 it can get very hard with 4 players which is a shame as it is only then that you get the full collaborative experience and synergies between characters 4 the only mechanic to slow down alpha players is that you are not meant to show your cards which arguably isnt really enough to stop those players 5 luck does play a big role in your success or failure there is no morale choice to make all choices are related to risk management coop best 24 a fun game if a bit simple a game that started a whole series of similar games where you start your turn with several actions to hold the tide just for a bit longer then you draw 2 cards looking to find a set of a single colour and then something bad happens on the board i can see how it might have looked amazing when it came out in reality these days there are much better alternatives and pandemic on its own feels very formulaic to me i dont think i would ever say no if offered a session but id never seek out to play it a fantastic fantastic fantastic game my very first playthrough simply blew me away  and usually it takes a couple of sessions before im really into a game but not this one simply amazing first introduction to coop boards thumbs up one the most beatiful coperative game the atmosphere is very close to the reality and the game is fun suggest to have for everyone 24 players pandemic really creates tension when you play it i found you can even play this solo with a few rule modifications a great part of this game is that cooperative gameplay can lead to interesting interpersonal communications who will emerge as the dominant voice my introduction to modern board games a fantastic execution of some wellthought out ideas a classic already although the alpha can be a problem if you let it this game is too much of a puzzle and not enough of a game for me it was fun a few times if you know the game and youre playing with people who dont there is no right thing to do you can tell them what to do which means theyre not really playing or you can leave them to their own devices and watch as you all lose i also feel like once youve got the roles figured out its very easy to tell early on whether youre going to win or lose and if youre going to lose exactly how and why ive heard that the expansions fix many of the problems but i want a game that is solid out of the box i dont mind expansions enhancing the game but they shouldnt have to fix it i know lots of people love this one we gave our copy to some friends who did location billy type family strategy sleeves ultimate guard katana transparent a family favorite great fun gifted away the classic gateway that got me into this mess one of the best coop games of all time the theme is incredibly tangible and comes through in a decent manner it has the right balance of complexity and difficulty personally the 10th is my favorite edition even with the screwups zmanasmodee refused to fix a fun puzzle to prone to alpha gaming this is probably my favourite game in my collection it may not be the one i personally like best thats agricola currently but its the one that the most people enjoy that we get to play most often it has an excellent balance of complexity tactics and fun that lets a new player pick up the game quickly and old players settle in and have fun each time the expansions add a ton of depth and variation to play and its fun to play even with just me and my wife which is an unusual feature in a game note the best rule we ever implemented was a limited amount of tabletalk this is a game where some players tend to boss around other players when were playing with one of those people we use an eggtimer at the start of each turn that timer is how long were allowed to discuss strategy once the timer runs out the person whose turn it is does whatever they want and were not allowed to argue about it action point allowance system fun coop game about stopping four global pandemics the outbreak mechanic is nice simulates the spreading of diseases in a fun way you also have to really coordinate with your fellow players by doing a lot of table talk the game might get a bit repetitive if played often though not much variety in the base game in the long run but the expansion helps on that aspect fran ais just always feel like there isnt much hope for saving the world coop games have not done it for me when i win i feel like it was simply a manageable distribution of city and epidemic cards i find competing with another human opponent much more compelling really fun so far great several first games then certain patters became apparent and it was easy to go through the game one 2player game we played almost according to rules just first cure was discovered in plain filed and some phases were skipped but this was correctedsuper tense atmosphere every move is important clock is ticking time is short and the end is near  i feel like being in the middle of the action of action movievery good components quality cards are almost plasticcoatedwaiting for futher games christmas gift from two good friends really enjoyable coop experience requiring table talk and planning cooperative game where up to 4 specialist try to save the world from deadly viruses  good for non gamers  easy to learn  different roles make different games  different levels of difficulty  lasts 45 minutes  not so exciting after a few plays  simple gameplay follows similar patterns each time on the brink except bioterrorist module if rating was on the size of the box it would get a 10 it has a soft silky feel too game play is excellent  joint puzzle solving with tension a race against the clock  one way to win but 3 ways to lose the theme fits perfectly  especially well used in the infecting drawdiscard pile oh and i like the dobbers trouble is that it is more than a discussion than a game so can imangine it wont get much play played again  and enjoyed it more so have rerated to an 8 i had played pandemic a total of two times in  before picking it up at a postholiday sale in the mall for 18 the two games i had did not really give me a fair representation of the game the first game was a learning game in which all the players involved were new to the game and struggling the rules the second play was months after the first and i had to relearn the rules again so it was more like a first play both times i played i saw some potential in the game i loved the epidemic mechanic and the fact that players had to interact and plan together in order to be successful but i didnt like it enough to buy it i bought the game because i love playing games with my family and this seemed like a nice fit for us it seemed light enough for my parents to handle hard enough to keep us coming back and the fact that it was coop meant that i could play with my family with out stressing them out with my play to win attitude after a few plays of this game i can say that i am sorry i didnt pick up this game earlier this has taken a seat along side ticket to ride carcassonne and settlers of catan as one of my familys favorite games to play the variability in difficulty is great because i can set it to easy for my family and harder for when my girlfriend and i play this two player i can see this game getting a lot of play in  it deserves it for a game that can be knocked out in 45 minutes it accomplishes a lot first heroic win 2 player medic  dispatcher  bought eclectic games reading july  theme medical interaction coop decent puzzle game with lots of replayability gotta love the virus mechanics terra has a similar theme plus a tension between acting in your own interests or playing cooperatively shadows over camelot has the traitor both would have been much less fun as purely cooperative games pandemic is a purely cooperative game pandemic models the spread of disease quite well and generates some tension through the infection and epidemic cards it is about making use of the various character specialisms as efficiently as possible increasing the number of epidemic cards in the deck allows less room for suboptimal play all perfectly competent but i dont find this puzzle very interesting and theres nothing else going on had played this once years ago at my cousins house but recently acquired a copy so we played a 3 player game yesterday we did well and thought we would win but ran out of cards to draw with the winning move only 1 turn away a big bummer but then we realized that we hadnt played the medics ability correctly after we found cures so we still chalked it up as a win was fun and a nice break from the common mess with each other games that we usually play and i definitely want to try out on the brink soon looks like it adds a whole new level as a dissenting voice let me say that i guess i just dont get this one i was looking forward to it but having played it a few times it just doesnt excite leaves me very cold girlfriend finds the theme depressing i read session reports and reviews each raving about the innovation and tension but it doesnt work for me nor for anyone ive so far played with its really frustrating to play a game with varied groups in the hope that one of them will say yeah man it really works for us basically its a cooperative game with a tickingbomb type of mechanism determined by the turn of a card its innovation is that when the bomb goes off infections escalate and the cards that have caused the epidemic are placed back on top of the stack to increase the threat wooo somebody wake me up to explain my problem with the game here it is you are reliant on all the other idiots around the table to succeed and even then its likely the system will screw you i think its because im excited by competing against the other players ive never liked solo games  theyre too dry this is essentially a solo game where you dont get to make all the decisions that lose you the game lots of people like this kind of guff im not one of them not my worst game ever but my biggest disappointment its a good game but its been replaced by other games forbidden island distills the pandemic experience down into something simpler defenders of the realm pumps pandemic up on steroids flash point fire rescue is roughly the same time and complexity but adds an element of tension that just isnt present in pandemic freedom the underground railroad is also a puzzlesolving coop but is so much more satisfying simply put one of my favorite games of all time the base mechanics are solid and open to a broad range of players with its relative difficulty and theme its not usually the first game i go to in breaking in a new gamer but its almost always in the first 2 or 3 so long as you can avoid playing with or being a table general and embrace the coop nature of the game pandemic is always a good time i am not a fan of this cooperative game i know it is probably the best coop game out there but i must not be a fan of the genre because i find it repetitive and boring plus it is hard to play with nongamers because you end up playing their turns as well i guess thats what i dont like about it one person can plan the whole thing one of the best games to convince nongamers into boardgames the downfall of this cooperative game is that it has strong potential to end up in quarterbacking where one player relays orders to the other players in order to achieve the objective it doesnt feel cooperative at all whenever any player is more experienced than the others if you need a cooperative game in your collection look elsewhere simple rules this depends a lot on the group like many cooperative games it can devolve into solitaire played by the most assertive player loved this when it came out but now prefer forbidden island or else something with more randomness if playing a long game like defenders of the realm nice and fast pacing coop light but good filler game  its cooperative and that describes exactly what happens the players are cooperating to defeat the diseases it can be boiled down to a multiplayer puzzle but the fun is seeing the different solutions that people take to the same problem verkauft pinnacle of coop games i wish there was a little more to it looking forward to playing legacy a good introductory coop played it a lot when it was new only for party game or family game with kids people who want cunning nature of board games or who are of competition would not enjoy it maybe after playing expansions i would change this review pandemic was one of the first games to get me into the hobby on the brink is still one of my favorite expansions to any game wonderful and suspenseful game tense puzzly coop of fighting diseases prone to quarterbacking so plays best with 2  making everyone involved good solo experience too yes as everyone will surely tell you pandemic is a great game though honestly whenever i play this game i feel like im playing defenders of the realm lite without the awesome fantasy theme and bosses to kill its definitely a a good alternative to defendersotrealm if you want shorter gameplay and less setup an easy to learn quick playing cooperative game that is new gamer friendly my wife loves it very tense game of cooperations damn near lost the first time finally mnaage to find the 4th cure even thoug we were one epidemic away from losing picked up a new copy from toyrus when it went under with open information theres always the risk of it devolving in to one player leading the group even when this risk is avoided im not a huge fan the mechanics of the game dont really appeal to me i find the colour scheme ugly i find the game quickly gets repetitive this may mainly be due to how i feel about coop games though as its the influence of other players upon your tactics and strategy that makes competitive games so engaging for me and the end result often feels driven by luck as much as good tactical decisions also in some respects im not a fan of how they applied the theme category light strategy  excellent coop game with strong theme tense complex and welldesigned the mechanics fit the theme quite well french new edition lent out to sophie also have on the brink well designed cooperative game easy to learn and teach variable difficulty makes the game more accessible another great coop game fairly abstract though ie we though we have named the diseases collecting coloured cubes to cure a disease is a bit meh my urlhttpwwwdaveexmachinacomwordpresspgame of the yearurl for  this is the game that made me rethink coops genuine tension scalable to the groups experience with it clever twists and actually feels like cooperation rather than just one or two players railroading the others the best cooperative game ive played its easy plays extremely fast yet can be highly challenging due to its different levels of difficulty fun to play cooperative board games my worldview changed when i got this game fully cooperative players encouraged to discuss moves together after playing it a couple times i feel like its a solved game doesnt feel like it has much replay value the most fun i have had playing a coop game probably because of the theme simple to learn and play and enough strategy to keep it interesting for a number of plays g pandemic is basically a richly themed cooperative puzzle with a lot of replayability highly enjoyable and incredible replay value easily replaces forbidden island one of my favorite games ever one of the best designed board games of all time i just dont enjoy it as some other ones 1  4 excellent coop game can begin to be redundant after many plays and once the players are experienced it is necessary to play at the hardest difficulty to really be challenged and luck begins to be a real factor at that difficulty still lots of fun light coop game that is easy to learn but has some nice random and unpredictable mechanics that makes it very tense i especially like the different roles and how they can interact with each other you really have to talk with your partners to get things going and make good use of their vital special abilities looking forward to play it with more players and more epidemics solid coop with a nice puzzle like feel to it and a good theme mechanics also work well with the action points system a solid coop game the theme does a relatively good job of pulling you in the mechanics are solid you do start to feel the pressure as the game progresses feels too much like a puzzle where everyone votes on proposed solutions and then executes one goes as slow as molasses but without much tension i usually pass easy enough game to learn fun coop style game h1n1 520 plays my favorite coop game load of fun good tension works well as a gateway for nongamers introduced my wife to coops with this one she enjoyed the 2 games we have played so far need some more plays to give it a review i need to play this more to properly evaluate it but so far it looks like the best coop game ever made and second place isnt even close great theme good components tough game system smooth gameplay and looks like some interesting expansions in the pipeline i should add that im not really into coop games so maybe giving it only a 75 doesnt do it justice own the boardgameon the brinkboardgame boardgamein the labboardgame and boardgamestate of emergencyboardgame expansions only through player cooperation can players hope to win which makes it different than every other game in my collection a modern classic and still a challenging coop game can coop games fall victim to the alpha player sure but then just don t play with that player because this really is a great game of trying to save the world from deadly diseases trying to balance finding a cure with controlling outbreaks is still makes for many difficult choices when you do win a game it feels well earned great game for first 10 plays sigillato a coop game that has good strategy and is not easy it only holds up to 4 players though susd bgg100 tabletop one of the best coops not keen on the 2p game as it is too easy im yet to try the expansions so maybe i should i do like the 34p game for its social aspect make sure to not play with alpha gamers though very good cooperation game with an easy and well designed system we started with forbidden island  desert also coop games from matt leacock and naturally bought pandemic this game a great balance of strategy and teamwork as well as offering a nice aesthetic the game board itself is a tad small for my liking  especially when 4 players are gathered around but that does not diminish the enjoyment of playing great for familyfriends game night cooperative 24 players 4 best age 10 60 min kk our wacky disease names black plague yellow fever blue balls and ubermeasles richard owns this one i can see why this game is a staple its simple and difficult at the same time im looking forward to getting to play it with more than one other person bouf recommends after playing this game for two times i got that coop board games are not for me not overrated just a very very good coop game the only game where it is not panic all the time only when those epidemic cards show up another fine cooperative game but i still just dont really like them not likely to be a favorite for me but fun with the right players im curious about the cthulhu retheme pandemic is my favorite game of all time it is a really clever coop game that i will always play and enjoy win 4 lose 10 the best with this game even though it isnt my favourite is that my game hating friends loves it i cant give it a lower grade because this boardgame allows me to play boardgames the game a recommend to new gamers how did we all get in this handbasket and why is it getting warmer its the end of the world as we know it and four players feel fine easy to learn coop game unfortunately offers few remedies to prevent a single player from dictating the dominant strategy ipad update i only play this solo now maybe i dont like coop games pandemic feels pretty dry to me like a group of players trying to fit together a jigsaw puzzle i keep trying to figure out why its so beloved here and failing update 6  7 this game is pretty fun solo on bsw i havent won yet playing the right rules 6 losses its still a dry puzzlelike game but at least now i do feel some tension figuring it out and hoping i draw the right cardsi classic coop suffers from quarterbacking sometimes but still offers reasonable fun although a few things could be tweaked this game is excellent and character classes feel pretty balanced the threat of being overcome by any of the four viruses while trying to create a cure in the meantime is amazing fun excellent coop game plays fast simple rules great challenge fun quick game to pick up and play but certainly hard to master ive played nine times so far with the least amount of epidemic cards but have only won about 13 times upgrades wanted meeple set   an infectious game in its own right great game to introduce family  friends to board gaming the game was recommended to me for years and i finally bought a copy in early  it is a great game and i always enjoy the variables the game throws at me rerated after a good proper sesson this is a good one but you need a good group always enjoy this the seven card hand limit annoys me as we usually play two player  otherwise great game wife loves this as well my first coop game it took some getting used to but it was a positive experience the components and theme are first rate pretty easy to learn and fun with 4 people the one main complaint about this game i have is the alpha player qbing one experienced person with a group of newbies too easy to slide into 1 guy playing solo with 3 people watching with the on the brink expansion this is a wonderful game without it it is still pretty good my rating is for with the expansion there doesnt appear to be that much strategy or decisionmaking in this game players dont have a lot of option on each term and there isnt a lot different ways to achieve victory it is however a good social game like shadows over camelot work cooperatively as a research team trying to cure a disease before it spreads across the world difficult but very fun each game is almost the same as the last ones after we played a couple of games we all got bored of it we talk and make a plan on how to win and after that its more or less an autopilot where you draw cards and place cubes nothing more a good groupbuilding game i dont know about replayability though  it seems the game could get boring after a while i only played it a couple of times i love this game includes stored in pandemic legacy season 2 box  in the lab  on the brink  state of emergency  promo roles stored in the closet removed from owns list this game is great if you have a group of people that express their opinion and also dont boss around definitely have to work and plan together plays quickly probably 35 minutes also works well with 2 players we usually play 2 characters each so it is like a 4 player game everyone is cooperating anyway so it doesnt change things much except you actually see both characters hands that you are playing third game i got after i started playing as a geek i count ticket to ride as one game and catan as well like it very much but the suspense in the legacy season games is getting me towards them instead as goes for all cooperative games game experience depend on your coplayers attitude towards interrupting your game i liked it but its a bit short in my view the game should end with all diseases exterminated theme is very exciting  interesting cooperative play is very group friendly especially for those new to heavier boardgaming as you get good at this game though youll quickly find that there is usually an obvious  best move and the group hivemind ends up autopiloting the game game is brutal on higher difficulties to the point where sometimes it is just impossible to win will be selling at bggcon i have the first edition im looking to trade for the second edition location glasgow our cooperative game of choice now bags of fun always especially loved at games club great game easy to learn but still challenging good replayability excellent components one of the few games i can play multiple times in a row without getting bored el mejor juego cooperativo en mi opini n solo theoretisch m glich just got this today played the introductory game with 3 players very fun everyone liked it became a little tense when we had a few outbreaks back to back i love this game for its simplicity to teach and its strategic depth i havent played it enough yet to have a failsafe solution thoroughly enjoy it also on my ipad still love this game even though we beat it a bit more often now c 75 tight and difficult even with experienced coop game players the intensification mechanic shuffle the discard pile and place it on top of the deck is a very clever way to both focus attention for a given game and to provide a good degree of replayability across multiple plays very nice cooperative game good theme  well im biased since im a medical student   might have some problems with replayability but still a excellent game easy to learn first step in cooperative game good gateway coop its nice because its easy to learn and teach others and short enough to play often but the theme is a bit dull this was an instant hit its a tense game that can certainly spiral out of your reach and it feels like youre always missing something which makes it a heck of a challenge but a heck of a lot of fun as you try to balance everything i was completely unsure of how a cooperative game would go over but im a total convert to the pandemic bandwagon weve tried it with extended family to great success classic and great gateway game always a hit bought from boardgamerie in my first boardgame purchase and everyone ive played it with has loved it even theo luke asks to play it relentlessly its a fantastic game  edition by zman games first cooperative game owned great experience digital  physical fun game and a good one to play with people not used to modern board gaming since you are all working together certainly a challenging game to try to win oddly enough after having played through an entire campaign of pandemic legacy i have grown to enjoy base pandemic more as a result i now am going to probably try the expansions to pandemic if i can find them on sale at some point in time great classic cooperative game keeps the tension up as you try to win the game some alpha gamers like to take over with this type of game might need some unspoken etiquette rules its is fun pandemic gets a certain respect from me for its influence but i dont know if ill ever play it again great way to introduce people to board games though ios a cooperative game without the drawn out length of play that ive found shadows over camelot and battlestar galactica suffer from the theme fits the mechanics extremely well making this game shine you really feel like you are working together to contain rapidly multiplying strains of disease its easy to learn and fun to play a worthy addition to any collection great cooperative game that plays really quickly pretty clever mechanisms that fit well with the theme pretty fun as cooperatives go the first game really felt like we were at the mercy of the cards but by the second one i was starting to see the true amount of options we had it seems very difficult and i am not completely convinced that clever strategy outweighs the randomness here but it was fun enough that i want to play again and find out update playing this more pushed my rating up and then back down i guess i cant complain if i had fun playing it 30 times before i got bored but ultimately once you figure out the right way to play you just execute your plan and sometimes get screwed by the cards the end 14 players a great cooperative game although it falls apart with players of different skill levels who end up ordering the less experienced players around a lot of variability in difficulty makes the game occasionally frustrating but this is offset by the corresponding uncertainty of victory every game seems to be won or lost by the narrowest of margins i wanted to dislike this game but after having postponed playing it for as long as i could i can only admit that it is very good and the otb expansion brings it to another level excellent coop mayb have to revise my score love this game  great to play at the start of the game night and feel a bit sad when we put it away to play another even fun when drawing the initial infections at the beginning recently added the roles and events from on the brink  even more fun ios app on ipad is perfection and great solo  waiting for expansions  update  rated down a biti enjoy the game but just dont grab for it unless introducing new people who immediately fall in love with it played a fair amount and still never gets old  such a great game to introduce new people to  fairly easy to teach but always a nail biter great coop game really tense with different difficulty settings and it can be played in  minutes even with 4 players just finished my second play of this game and unfortunately i think of this game in relation to eldritch horror which i love how does it stack up both games build tension marvelously however where eldritch revolves on dice rolls pandemics gameplay is elegant and streamlined this makes the game somewhat more methodical and less of a romp but still feels thematic as the game is simply very well designed it is also 14 to 15 the length of eldritch horror and so even though the potential for memorable narratives in this game is far lower and it manages to generate at most frustration as opposed to dread i have to give this game the better score this is also a difficult game i have played edlritch horror 11 times and have triumphed over the warped machinations of the old gods 7 times of my two plays of this game i have twice been thwarted by the the lowest and most primordial of earthly life forms those looking for a challenge will not be disappointed the one theme breaking element i encountered in this somewhat abstracted game is at the end of my most recent play 2 player all diseases were cured 2 were eradicated and there was one disease cube of both of the other colors left and we lost because we ran out of cards to draw i say give us more character cards to draw with more interesting resources and events even if it means also adding more epidemic cards great theme cooperative too i like that this game while crazy popular on the geek right now is just okay in my book ive only played it twice and while it was a fun exercise in cooperation the game didnt really hook me in im sure well play it a few more times then it may sit and gather dust for a while update traded away after four plays this is a fine cooperative game my wife just doesnt really enjoy cooperative games this game was revolutionary when it came out but at this point there are a lot of games in this genre that have interesting spins or a more engaging theme for me good game just not for my group got to play twice an excellent cooperative game playing with open hands should really be the way to play since in real life which is the designers reason for not playing with open hands everyone has cell phones  especially hiend scientists trying to eradicate a disease open hand is the way to go coop letterp coop the originator of those coops still solid but i played too much pandemic legacy to want to play this again its a nice game to introduce modern games to nongamers solid cooperative game that feels very challenging there are a number of things you need to be doing and it always seems that just as youre close to putting out a fire here another one flares up over there best part of the game are the variable powers which enable and encourage the players to really need to work together to maximize the benefits of their abilities game is completely sleeved printouts for spanish edition available and translated cards are in the sleeves along english original game a great cooperative game simple to learn and fun to play i definitely prefer competitive games check out my review httpboardgamegeekcomthreadisitgoodwith14playerswithpictures still one of the best coop games i have played only reason it is previously owned and not owned is that i traded my copy in toward pandemic legacy season 1 much like candyland the outcome is often determined by the deck before you even start playing ciekawa gra trzymaj ca w napi ciu  swietna kooperacjamo na ratowa   wiat never expected this but after starting with the cure i can now even play this great game with my family 0 our first cooperative board game it was a hit however we have played it so often we are burned out on it de 2   4 joueurs great coop game easy to learn 241  5 love it but every group i have played with just seems to run out of time my last game ended up with us one action short of curing the final disease amazon this is ok because my extended family really appreciates working together with the various roles the roles work well in facilitating interaction the game play gets less intriguing after 5 or 6 games but as i said its a nice little vehicle for cooperative play when you are working together the tension can get fun when you know a card that could cause a terminal outbreak could come out this turn but youll be able to prevent it next turn if it doesnt any flavour of pandemic is always a welcome break from being pummelled in competitive games and this is the quintessential coop perfect game for a germophopic society save the world from disease in a game before a super virus takes us out in real life fun for everyone a great cooperative game if it has one serious flaw it is simply that one player can take the band director role and essentially drive the strategy of the whole game very well designed game the cooperative aspect is a big hit with my group por fin un juego cooperativo que merece la pena chungo y extresante siempre te da la impresion que estas a punto de palmarla y al final puedes ganar le pongo un 85 si no se quema seguramente le subire la nota y si se quema muy pronto se la bajare el dia del estreno ya jugamos 3 partidas pues son relativamente rapidas y te quedas con ganas de revancha editado un juegazo que no aburre se lo pasa uno bien de 2 a 4 jug por igual una vez que sabes jugar no es tan dificil nosotros tendremos que empezar a jugar en el nivel mas dificil editado 2 en nivel intermedio el juego toma su dificultad perfecta es dificil ganar aunque si tienes suerte y jugais bien se consigue one of the simplest and best coop games dynamics generally make for a tense hour of playing good replay value great coop if you dont take it too serious i prefer pandemic iberia reaped for space although i like the game i prefer a game like forbidden island because it has more replayability still a fun game in its own right and should definitely earn a spot in everyone collection first coop game ever really enjoyed the puzzle aspect and working with my boyfriend to finish it good light gateway game with base but the expansions really had to the depth and strategy rating is with expansions 10th anniversary edition pandemic is my game of choice whenever a cooperative game has to hit the table it beats any other one by thematic by mechanic by emphasis on the urgency to complete the tasks the game works perfectly only one single non minor remark suffers badly from alpha gamer syndrome a good solid cooperative game an experienced player may take too much lead as in all cooperative games my wife and my favorite coop game  works super w 2 this is a great game to play with nongamers its tricky enough that you have to think hard to win its a cooperative game so everyone feels good when you win as long as your collective decisions are made cooperatively this is the collaborative game fresh rapid lethal never equal to itself absolutely suggested contains on the brink expansion somewhat of a gateway game in our group but still gives a good challenge to the seasoned types as well just cannot get into this game i love the idea good mechanics have tried on several occasions with different groups as bio terrorist from expansions with 2 people it just doesnt do anything for me this game is a very good introduction level cooperative game for new players and it is very tense and fun this game does sometimes fall into the trap where one person begins to control and tell everyone what to do which does tend to get annoying but with the right group this game is phenomenal and is so much fun to play this is my wife and my goto game i only rank it a 9 with the on the brink expansion which is a mustbuy as it provides diversity of challenges and player roles to overcome the problem of pandemic growing stale pandemic is very entertaining the rules are easy to learn the beginning of each game develops similarly but there are lots of road blocks that spring up causing everybody to change their plans lots of fun here always a good time highly recommended easy to get people into ios excellent coop game and excellent introduction game 26p 45 min medical coop gw 24 rank 51 hmmm our first two plays were over so quickly it seemed like the game was broken however with a bit more luck and a following wind we managed to scrape home on the third game so challenging and i think a good game in here great intro to gaming i have the second ed  very pretty i havent played any expansions seams like a good solid game you can get screwed by the cards like in any card based game wife does not like it much 24pb4age 10 always different pandemic provides a challenging experience every time it works with any number of players one to four albeit with a different feel with each option and it is a decent solitaire option the on the brink expansion adds a fifth player and several new roles and game play options still a fantastic hit novel and full of tension can sometimes feel a bit repetitive though would like to play this more with 3 players played recently again had a good time in the lab on the brink gets more interesting the more often i play im really looking forward to getting more time with the expansion really enjoyable enough strategy to be interesting but enough change to be frustrating mucho spaz also a bit of advice your goal is to cure the diseases not eradicate them dont spend all your time cleaning cites because time will run out sooner than you think my favorite gateway coop game for a heavier coop i look to eldritch horror one of my favorite games for some reason i have a hard time finding others to play this game perfect for people starting out however suffers from a game that can too easily slip into a single player with everyone else being a remote player cooperative game where players are racing the clock to save humanity from four diseases spreading across the world our favorite coop and probably the game that started my obsession with hobby board games multiple groups of friends have purchased this game after plays with us definitely a modern classic man that was fun i like cooperative games so this seemed like a sure win for me it turned out to be pretty bland however i find that the theme just doesnt draw me in and the gameplay is kind of simplistic and boring i dunno i just didnt care for it boring highly repetitive but nice surge mechanic one of the best coop games around highly recommended great game for a group i think i just got burned out on it only interested in trading for the second edition ive been hearing about this game nonstop since i got interested in board games i held off a long time because i simply didnt like forbidden island and such so it was never really high on my list found the game on sale bought it and damn this is a good game never seen my group work that well together than when trying to plan out the turns here very good game i can see that there could be some issues with alpha gamers but we had no such issues this made me decide to definitely get pandemic legacy next edit eventually decided to trade this away because pandemic iberia completely replaced it for me still a great game but just not as great as iberia  ns8 very good cooperative game its a pity that its only for 4 players  the game is fun but it seems the person with the strongest personality ends up telling everybody else what to do i would like to see this game played with typea personalities only i dont think they would make it to the end the cooperative game by which all others must be judged challenging but winnable the virus ahem cube spreading mechanics echo a reallife outbreak of contagions other coops may improve on what pandemic already does well but when it comes down to it pandemic is solid as a rock and has all you really need if i could own just one coop this would be it ios  gran combinaci n de mec nica y tem tica  excelentes componentes  gran variedad de poderes de personajes  much sima rejugabilidad  puede enfundarse y guardarse en inserto original  permite controlar la dificultad  ninguna mec nica mitiga el efecto l der i like this one a lot so far very tense this is a good coop game for certain groups one game in and my wife and i really like it nice building tension as diseased breakout and spread we found ourselves discussing the game how we could have done better for the rest of the evening this just works so well for us we like the coop part we like the puzzleefficiency and all in a package of building urgency along with expansions this is my 1 favourite game i am always down to play it a great game to play with friends and family builds teamwork and relationships every session are different from one another although sometimes pandemic will be extremely difficult when the team are drawing pandemic card back to back it is still a great challenge for the whole team ive played multiple times with my group and everyone really enjoys playing it great game but not my favourite version of pandemic favorite game of all time 10th anniversary edition better as an app on the brink im not usually a fan of pure coops but this ones pretty good its harder with 4 or 5 expansion allows for 5 its a quick game and youre likely to play it twice in a row when you get it out super solo spielbar  amazing doctor doctor one of the greatest coop games out there in my opinion the game works well with any number of people and by adding in just a couple of cards each new game you can easily make the game easy or omg zombie apocalypse difficult very difficult to beat the game cooperative one of the best co op game that never gets old and is a great gateway game highly recommend playing with on the brink expansion at the minimum replayability is high pandemic is the only coop game ive ever played i never really saw the appeal of coop games until somebody brought this in to work after my first play through i knew i needed to buy it in pandemic you and the other players are all trying to cure 4 diseases before they outbreak too much and just become unmanageable you will start with 9 random cities with disease cubes on them the first 3 get 3 cubes the next 3 get 2 cubes and the last 3 get 1 cube the world is grouped into 4 regions denoted by colors for each of the 4 diseases the starting cities get the color of disease cube for the color of city they are each player now takes a special role that will help them specialize in things that will help out in the game now the players need to build research stations remove disease cubes share knowledge and eventually cure all 4 diseases the difficulty comes from the constant onslaught of disease cubes after each players turn the next cities are flipped over and receive disease cubes if a city gets flipped over and it is already at 3 cubes it then outbreaks giving one cube to each city attached to it throughout the player deck epidemics are included as these come up you get a brand new city with 3 cubes in addition all those cities youve already been adding cubes to yes those ones youve been removing cubes from as well get shuffled and thrown right back on top to add even more cubes this is a rewarding game it is fun to work together and not have to come up with the strategy all by yourself it might be good to play the first few times with open hands but i wouldnt do that for long it might be easier but it seems like it turns into 1 or 2 people running the whole game i gave this a 7 because it is quick to play and offers a lot of tough decisions in that short amount of time if you lose at least it was only 15 or 20 minutes so you can easily get in another game to try and win if playing with only 4 epidemics becomes to easy just add one once you get up to 6 which is the most for the base game things get really tough so you will never feel like this game is too easy i love this game and i am really looking forward to the expansion on the brink bgame lengthb short

play as a couple great game found it a little loose and repetitive did not feel the love that so many have for this one based on solo games and games with the family rating  indifferent easily one of my favorite games to play with the wife great game i have probably played over a hundred times london not a bad game for a couple of plays pretty hard but ultimately unimpressive with its repetetiveness pandemic is a fun coop game that suffers from low replayability the first 34 games may be a challenge but once you get the subtilities of the game it can become very easy even with the maximum amount of epidemics we even made a tournament in our game store in wich different team competed to see who finishes the game first however the light ruleset makes it a very good familily  casual coop game to one more thing the expensions add more level of difficulty to the game and makes it much better and harder i rate 6 for the basic game and 75 with the expensions great theme and a decent intro to coop games for newer gamers can quickly devolve however to strong players essentially playing the less assertive players turns for them often has that great feeling of baling water out of a holeriddled rowboat oh gosh another extremely annoying cooperative game my first cooperative great game i had a lot of fun until i discovered the legacies and since then i haven t played it anymore coop damage control excellent implementation this is the only coop game that i enjoy it is difficult without being pointless what is especially nice is that the game is simple enough for newbies while still offering a challenge 24 players 25 players with on the brink expansion 16 players with the in the lab expansion some scenarios require on the brink coop a fun cooperative game thats very easy to learn not sure why but it didnt stick with me the first time i played this game i was blown away by how cleverly constructed it was the whole game mechanism fits so well with its theme and i wanted to replay the game straightaway this game as well as london by martin wallace has really got me into taking board gaming more seriously una partida a dos con cuatro cartas de pandemia en el mazo y  victoria pero hasta el  ltimo momento parec a que el mundo iba a cubrirse de enfermedades finalmente obtuvimos la cuarta cura pero es un juego tenso e inmersivo despu s de mucho tiempo sin jugar fue una grata experiencia espero repetir pronto awesome game it isnt seeing much play though now pandemic legacy is released an okay game but one that my group of players and i ultimately chose not to keep due to many of the games feeling rather samey after a while even with the first expansion a fine game but there are other coop games we like a lot more not a fan of cooperative board games pandemic is the best of the coop games i have played a really good coop game great for introducing new players rated as a 9 with on the brink expansion for trade second edition with extra decks of brand new in shrink cards a decent coop but ive grown to love others more however i will definitely be getting pandemic legacy ifwhen that ever happens jul  currently one of my groups favorites problem comes of course with coop play someone may end up being dictator and it takes a concerted effort to keep that from happening it may still be fun for all involved but being allowed to make your own decisions is really what makes a game fun fun game to play unlees you have the leader guy in your group dont invite himher gh p2 p3 p4 wow family and friends love this if over 10 and teaches geography science medicine and its cooperative so everyone interacts to strategize toward common goals extraordinary my first expeience with a coop game apart from lord of the rings and i really enjoyed it rating is based on a single play and first impression the game utilizes some very innovative mechanics not the least of which is when the diseases intensify by reshuffling the discard deck and placing them back on top of the draw pile this is an excellent and clever mechanic that had us scratching our heads at first until the lightbulb of understanding shone upon us update ive now played this lots of times and my rating stands it is tense and enjoyable even if fairly random the intial placement of 3cube diseases relative to the players starting position in atlanta can have a huge impact as can the randomly selected player roles when the first epedemic card turns up and when the special cards turn up if they are near the bottom of the deck theyre not going to be of much help despite the random aspects i still really enjoy it i think its one of the most innovative games in years great game but requires effort to avoid having one player dictate everyones moves a classic that i will include on my list of gateway games this is one of those games that you can talk most newcomers into playing by asking them do you want to save the world pandemic is a coop where all players work together towards a common goal  save the world from rampant diseases everyone picks a character card with a unique ability and the four viruses are set up to begin infecting the human race at an incredible rate your job is to stop the epidemics and save humanity its pretty cool no one has to feel the pressure to compete but as with most coops winning the game is not so easy with this game you get simple rules quick playthroughs and lots of player interaction 710 favourite cooperative game essential to have on the brink expansion to really enjoy variety of challenges i can imagine a situation in which i would turn down a game of pandemic but thats only hypothetical i think its a gem of a cooperative game and ive found it fun and really challenging every time ive played cooperative fun fun cooperative game but i dont typically want to play with more than 2 players because unless you are playing optimally as a team the game will usually beat you i dont like to offer up suggestions for what another player should do because it can be hard to do so without sounding like your not really giving the person their own choices the game encourages you to interact and plan together though which is why i prefer to play with just 2 or even on my own just my personal awkward hangups i guess i always want people to make their own decisions in games and not just follow instructions still a great game even if it is very much luckdependent on harder difficulties a good gateway game pandemic is one of the first modern board games ive played and my first cooperative one there are newer cooperative games i like more such as spirit island and the captain is dead but pandemic is still a pretty good great cooperation game work fine with two players i want to love this game but i just dont i keep trying and trying i play it every now and again but my issues with the game just never get resolved 1 i hate how it scalesif you play at 4 players you may not get a 3rd turnno fun 2 thematically and mechanically running out of resource cards is about the stupidest contrived and wholly arbitrary way to end a game as you can get its right up there with roll and move if you ask me why not reshuffle the discards and keep on playing hate that no game should end because you cant draw a freaking card 3 9 out of 10 games can basically be scripted as winning or losing simply by how the initial random layout goes in combo with the first few turns andor the distribution of cards at the beginning of the game if a player lucks into drawing their 3rd and 4th card of one color on their first turnor the initial distribution is particularly nicethe game can be a breezeand equally impossible to win if everyone struggles to get a pair of same color cards turn after turnand dont get me started on how annoying it is you have to be on the actual city to trade the city cardmy god thats stupid you should be able to at least trade cards of the same color in the region of that color for me the game is way to dependent on random draws random distribution of cubes which means you can basically get easy games and impossible to beat games without any actual game play i love the theme of the game and the mechanics are great the outbreaks the moving around the boardi just think they created arbitrary limitations to gameplay which just jacks up the difficulty of an already difficult game to win ive played the game dozens of times won my first game like 10 games in solely by lucky draws and though i have played games where it was fun right up to the end win or lose i still found myself frustrated by the dozens of losses that i never felt were a result of my gameplaythey were either unwinnable to begin with or just one frustration piled upon another like when the initial cluster of cubes are all centered around central and eastern asia and the first outbreak in the region causes a chain reaction that ends the game before the 3rd player in a 3 player game gets a 2nd turnthats no fun there are just too many no fun outcomes to this game i shouldnt have to house rule this game to make it fun i dont know maybe its just the nature of the cooperative beast i guess id just rather play a competitive game where every game there is at least one winnerthan a coop game where 90 of the games end up with everyone losing and again its not the winning or losing that make a game fun i realize that if i lose the game by the skin of my teeth and was this close to winningthats great its losing game after game simply by chance and luck where it doesnt matter how well you playthats just frustrating and not fun thats where i am with this game alla hj lps  t att r dda v rlden fr n 4 st virus one of the best cooperative games i have played its always a close thing at the end and you can only win if everyone does their part simple boring no reason to have more than one person playing love this game amazing probably played this at least 100 times in the 23 months weve owned it just subscribed to bgg a couple days ago one of my favorite overall games and definitely my favorite coop game  update  dropped this to an 7 8 with the expansion dont really want to get it out much anymore but will still suggest it to new players and would never turn down a game very rarely will play the base game anymore fast cooperative game where four anonymous diseases red dandruff blue pox galloping mumps and coeliac disease in our house are spreading across the globe players are members of a response team to contain and cure the horrible beasties fairly standard cooperative game ie lord of the rings stuff  first do a little bit of good in the fight move research treat etc then advance the bad side of things possibly triggering consequences tightly designed attractively packaged despite the enormous pieces small board and the fact the game truly reeks of some chemical  paint three differently levels of difficulty five games in and were pretty much done  fast tight but very vanilla for a cooperative game roberts family shelf great game and great to start people out on so long as they like to plan ahead and strategize rules are very simple though it takes some time to understand how the rules and mechanics play out definitely has a feel of urgency and tension collaboration is not only a natural sideeffect but also a requirement to win live  25 have played this a lot in the past sold it bought the new edition and then wasnt sure i would keep it but my wife and i have played it and she loves it and i can see why this is a game that will be in my top 10 great coop still loving it one star down you are always one turn away for winning or losing but its anticlimatic as hell the time mechanic player deck does not allow for tactical adaptation find a single way to finish the game in time is usually the motto and this is the quarterbacking heaven the iconic cooperative game you allways feel like there is not enough time to do everythin you want and then when you win it allways feels like an achievement the player powers also let you do cool manouvres that makes you feel verry useful clever and powerful i understand why its already a classic great theme easy to learn rules quick pace nice components scalable difficulty playable with all type of gamers and non gamers still placing the shuffled infection discard pile on top of the remaining infection draw is a mechanic that doesnt convince me i understand its necessary because othwerise it would be too easy to avoid outbreaks and it also fastens the pace but it also creates some non desirable for me effects  all the action of the games happens on very specific places lack of movement through the world  favors the creation of fixed strategies that youll carry from one game to the next creation of investigation centers in affected cities to move quickly between spots etc  if 2 epidemy cards are very close one to the other youll face a big problem if this happens twice at the end of the day success on games for good or for bad can be determined solely by the random placement of the cards still its a game i love to play from time to time the game that got me into coops not bad for a coop game not sure what all the rage is about coop games though better than soc for sure as with most coop games this doesnt have a lot of replay value this was also a first for me playing a cooperative game i played this with my wife and my father and we loved it another great game best coop game ive played a lot of fun my favorite solitaire game pandemic was a great game and puzzle to start into the hobby with but ive become too much of a quarterback so i dont really bring it out anymore i love the cooperative idea what i run into as an issue is that it seems to end up simply being a puzzle game for one person i often find i end up simply suggesting telling the others what to do for us to succeed game for good friend a classic one of the few games i enjoy playing by myself the board game snob in me doesnt want to like pandemic because regular stores are starting to sell it lol but pandemic is so wellknown for a reasonit is intense fun for the whole family one of the best cooperative games on the market with a really unique theme i like it best with the in the lab expansionit is probably just an 70 without it im rating it with it because that is how we always play it my most played coop game and one of my favorite game ever great coop game you cant go wrong with this unless you let alpha players take over though most people i played with didnt i quite enjoyed it i thought a cooperative game without cylons would be very boring but i was wrong chopping block frantic game players must travel the globe to collaboratively contain research and cure outbreaks before they reach pandemic status each player uses his unique powers which strengthens abilities to travel research etc random events and a fast clock make this a challenging game this is a solo game posing as a cooperative game the players actions usually end up being determined by the one guy who has the most experience with the game not really fulfilling to play and win but then again i enjoy competitive games much more finally got around to playing this  and i liked it fine no dice thats a plus and the randomness of the infection cards has an element of calculability is that a word played it with my wife and we both liked it  a keeper for the time being the one hour went by somewhat fast best cooperative game ive played gets better with every play excellent game that can be frustrating sometimes the card draw is so unfair in some games it feels you are cursed very tactical and thrilling game immersive theme easy to play played solo good puzzle game difficulty increases with fewer characters as a group is interesting game so long as noone tries to be in control too much as it can ruin the others fun simple easy maybe awesome fun yes 8 the game that got me into the hobby and allowed me to forget years of trauma from playing monopoly and risk a solid puzzle to play over and over with friends on first match i see more options and interesting development than in forbbiden island good game very tense score is based in pandemic and on the brink expansion update more plays and still interesting update this game is interiorized now so i like to play it many times good enough for that with on the brink expansion great 85  9 update game is not bad but with many matches changing cards becomes a bit samey and boring 9  8  trying to figure out how to add myself to pandemic httpbitlycyzjza  im happy with how the pharmacist turned out httptwitpiccom12bek2  next up was pandemic played with 5 epidemics and got killed only 2 cures found no yellow diseases to start meant the rest were hit hard  mleacock any word on a 2nd expansion for pandemic any chance a pharmacist could be included i once got an emergency call from the cdc  mischakrilov pandemic is my most played game the past couple of years im not sure about the extended stats ive been using friendless  rewatching 12 monkeyslooks like its time to break out pandemic again httpwwwboardgamegeekcomimagepandemiconthebrink   mleacock pandemic poetry httpbitlyggqgrh  what a great review  pandemic was great 5 players won with 5 epidemics in the deck still my favorite modern board game since acquire awesome game as you all know one of the few that the wife really enjoys playing with me storage very good condition box includes pandemic on the brink another coop game that i love especially when we bring out the bioterrorist option great coop game works great with two players great theme its probably because the wife and i work in health care that we enjoy this one so much looking forward to owning the expansion have not explored the game difficulties yet expansions to get one the brink in the lab rules are simple and yet there is a ton of options and strategy downside that is possibly present in many cooperative games i find that one or two people often im one of them understand the game better or are more into it than the other players and as a result end up dictating what the other players should do and this makes the game less fun for them probably at its best as a solo game i like it but not enough to get expansions the board game without atmosphere for me i played the game during covid19 but still same impressions rated a 10 with 25 plays  this is the only coop game that allows for real teamwork has almost zero downtime provides lots of tough choices and has enough builtin variability to be played again and again an initial doubleheader of this is almost mandatory pandemic also affords some of the best twoplayer gaming with experienced players one of the things the rulebook sort of glosses over is that playernumber impacts the difficulty nearly as much as epidemic number with 2players being easiest lately my girlfriend and i have moved onto 2p6e 2player 6 epidemics were doing fairly well i still think my favorite way to play pandemic is 3p5e ive tried 3p6e and even with clear boons of luck from the deck it usually ends in disaster its been 40 or so games since i last tried though i rarely play with four id much rather play space alert if there are four of us but if i do i usually keep it to 4 epidemics more often than not the major threat in 4p4e is running out of time because the cards are split four ways i feel like the luck of the draw cure sets has a somewhat higher impact every now and then its fun to play 5p5e not actually allowed in the rules you need that extra epidemic to make up for the fact that you have every advantage at your disposal update an incredible game but its so playable and accessible and innovative and fun that it is possible to eventually play it out im still a big fan but play rarely i cant imagine downgrading it below a 9 though having played 150 times im not the one suggesting this anymore but if an enthusiastic new player wanted me on the team id be there in a heartbeat collaboratif tres belle mecanique original colle bien au th me clever design lots of strategic decisions good social game with a good group but works solo as well the presence of some free actions does seem to cause rules confusion pnp fun cooperative game update the more i play this the more i love it rating up from 7 to 8 i like the idea of a coop game and this one is fairly fun when we win i feel like we were on the brink of losing and when we lose it feels like we were on the brink of winning awesome coop game we teach people forbidden island first but this game is much better for the challenge it s a modern classic in board gaming if your starting to dip a toe into coop and solid strategy this is a great next step a cation to gamers it is a gate way game you ll want other themes and there are plenty second game my wife and i got in the modern game   genre   and is still loved the played count is so outwe played this and ticket to ride to death on our first winter in our gaming journey base game by itself is not worth keeping a brilliant cooperative game fun theme tight gameplay its a classic for a reason theres a quarterbacking risk as with most coop games but its usually not bad enough to ruin the game the only time ive not had fun is when half the players are experienced and half arent it be hard not to steamroll peoples opinions in that case sell or give away colaborativo neat cooperative game another game thats easy to pick up and learn while providing a constant challenge strong emphasis on team work id really enjoyed playing this game and then covid19 hit and well it feels a little too close to home these days playing the easy version with the kids my son takes the medic and my daughter the scientist this is my introductory game with friends who want to play a boardgame i just dont like cooperative games but i can see why some people like it made by the same guy as forbidden island and it shows the game is basically a more hardcore version of forbidden island and where forbidden island is a bit too light this is a bit too heavy for the time it takes to play its still good and fun but it runs a bit long in the teeth for what it is also if you can find the incredibles of pixar fame variant give it a shot its a lot of fun but somewhat harder  7  7  7  7 the game that got us into the hobby and we still love it this has been our go to for shorter games now that we have the cure im curious to see which will hit the table more can not win  you think you can contain the epidemics but then a single outbrake blooms into four or the time simply runs out a fun coop game update totally fired by forbidden island  bye pandemic a great weeknight game havent found a time where it challenged me yet or when i lostthat is its downfall if it were harder itd be a 9 or a 95 very fun game with replayability based on randomness and different roles but restricted to needing to accomplish the same goal every game as well as only certain strategies being viable to win the game as with all straight coops it requires certain group dynamic all players engaged all with similar skill level none of them too bossy when i find such a group i will probably enjoy this game much more its fun but the theme is not that interesting for me pretty much the only downside for me dont let that stop you from enjoying it there are so many great things about this game  it really emphasizes teamwork creates an element of fear and excitement and allows for great communication its awesome for groups as well as 2 players and i like how the game is slightly different every time  depending on difficulty and which cities are chosen i havent had a chance to play any of the expansions yet but im really excited for when i do wonderful coop and gateway a bit puzzley this is one coop that i can kind of stand to play it occassionally devolves into one player that knows the game best giving orders to his underlings i refuse to play this without the bioterrorist expansion grim theme but great coop frist ed nice game even solo i enjoy playing this multiple times in a row  which is pretty unusual for me and therefore high praise save the world from disease you probably wont though doesnt make it to the table nearly as much as it used to but im still happy to play when it does a nice puzzler that plays relatively quick beaucoup de strat gie un jeu ou on est loin de gagner   chaque fois really fun coop game does run the risk of serious quarter backing happening not a favourite have felt like an observer in a couple of plays where the experienced players begin by explaining why your action isnt the best choice then later just tell you your optimum moveand by the end just move your pieces for you would like to try again with players of similar inexperience excellent strategy game with a lot of replay value as each game is a random outbreak weve had it for about two weeks and are still enjoying it  just received on the brink expansion today so hope to review it soon exchanges complexity with luck the game is hard yes but not because you need a good tactic to win but because this tactic needs to magically align with the random draw of player cards it is  maybe  a simple introduction into collaborative games but i wouldnt waste my time with it there are far better ones out there ah i dont find it very fun to sit and discuss what were all going to dowere not playing against anyone or anything it doesnt really feel like im playing a game at alljust kind ofplanning our gaming groups new favorite that everyone agrees to play playing is simple and straightforward everyone gets to do something my favorite coop game love the theme quite enjoyable not difficult to understand even for a new player after playing it i bought iberia and reign of cthulhu for me more thematic the better the best coop ive played but it still just doesnt work for me i hear other games being called multi player solitare but coop games i actually can play multiple roles as solitare a tightly balanced game with strong buzz the nature of the game will probably limit is long term appeal 716 a30 same as horrified move do what you can then draw the bad cards we enjoy the cooperative aspect for some reason i enjoy this game much more when played as a 2player classic cooperative my wifes favorite i love it too cath right now its a nine but im close to moving it up to 10 my experience with cooperative games is that they lose their excitement after a time and the ratings dip  but this one is starting at a very high point tense short and fraught with peril  pandemic is one of the best themetogame marriages that ive come across you know i like this game i really really like it strangely i think i might like it more when i lose because of the nervewracking adrenalinepumping condition of being completely overrun by disease who knew a coop could be so cool one of the best games on the market and my favorite of the cooperative games work as a team to cure 4 diseases before you run out of cards or the disease explodes out of control endless replayabilty lots of different strategic options difficulty level can be adjusted do not confuse this with pandemic legacy which is one of the worst games ive ever played pandemic  top game on my shelf pandemic legacy  hours of my life id pay to have back u ywana cena zakupu 80 z  expansions on the brink love itjust love it not my fave coop the theme worksit feels scripted but overall it works for what it is decent game if you want to keep it casual and like coop games personally i prefer my coop games to have a traitor mechanic theres also always the risk of an opinionated player taking over the session making it less fun for the less involved excellent game that everyone liked didnt expect much of a cooperative game but it exceeded my expectations pandemic is a good game if people dont spend to much time playing quarterback and dominating the decision making of what to do lots of hype from every source has an extremely thematic feel to it so far it seems to fit the bill as a fast coop with simple rules and lots of replayability so good and so difficult to be good at read the directions carefully as many people out there claim to beat it regularly but do not play according to the rules it is very team oriented and would be a great game to play with family as the stronger players can help out the weaker highly recommend overrated 2 player games are ridiculously easy people who know what theyre doing can beat the game easily even on the highest difficulty highly prone to quarterbacking some might say then dont be a quarterback then the quarterback doesnt have any fun because they know how to win but are forced to keep their mouth shut while other people make bad decisions probably good for 4 players who are either new to the game or experienced with the game not a mix of the two doesnt fit our group looking to sell cooperative can be lame if too many optimizing bullies playing with new players buen juego para combinar con alguna expansi n classic coop great entry level game introduction to modern board gaming we dont actually get this to the table a lot in neither of my two and a half player groups either its not confrontational enough or its theme is not fantastic enough funny is that my wife doesnt really want to play this one either ill have to go and play it with those friends of whom i know that they enjoy it some time the mechanics are neat particularly fun is how when you shuffle you keep the cards you drew before on top so you know that those troublesome herds of disease will pop up again and soon this does make gaming the deck a valid strategy as well of course and maybe hurts thematic immersion a bit but adds more strategy to the game what i also like is the way the difficulty levels make the game suitable for all kinds of groups 2p3p4p sold too easy for 12 players to take over and dictate everyone s moves often leads to an argument fantastic multiplayer coop game great for gamers that like strategy and are familiar with coop strategy games very challenging game but great fun if youre new to hobby games i would recommend getting forbidden island first but once youve mastered that go for pandemic x we played this one nonstop in a weekend after that it rarely hits the table i just don t really seem to like it  and i ve tried maybe it s because i ve played 2 player most of the time maybe it s because i seem to get a pandemic and outbreak bonanza at the very first turn half the time maybe it s because i feel like i dominate with my opinions whilst playing it maybe it s the drab colours of the game board maybe because i m not playing against the smarts of another person either way i ve never felt any real desire to play it after any of the games i ve been involved with the only reason i keep trying is because it s considered a classic try legacy then i like the game muy buen cooperativo puro y duro donde la planificaci n lo es todo adolece del famoso efecto l der pero jugando con las personas adecuadas se convierte en una experiencia gratificante cuando curas las 4 enfermedades justo en el  ltimo turno we all knowthose viruses are zombies holds the record for our mostrepeatplaysinasingleday my personal favorite cooperative game pandemic has you playing the role of one of five distinct international medical specialist whose job is to work with between one and three other specialists to find the cures for four deadly and infectious diseases before they overrun the planet this game has just the right mixture of simplicity cooperation variety and tension that gives it near infinite replayability while a pretty simple game to get the hang of it is still incredibly difficult to win at times and the mounting tension in some games can be pretty intense so the game can certainly be intimidating that said this is one game i keep coming back to and provided you play with people who like to work together with others towards a common good you will love this game the apocalyptic biological plague theme while not laid thick works very well with mechanics highly recommended as is the wonderful expansion a new classic one of my favourite cooperative games complicated enough to appeal to gaming veterans but not so complicated that newbies cant play and the cooperative mechanics mean even an inexperienced player can play with veterans without fear of being mislead by an overly competitive opponent recommend for any gaming collection great game this base game is the best one of the funnest coop game ive played so far great cooperative fun nowadays im almost incapable of playing pandemic without the on the brink expansion which adds quite a lot of depth to the base game if you know the game better than your coplayers or if you just enjoy being the leader try to avoid quarterbacking other players and let them decide on their moves themselves obviously helpful hints and reminders should be welcome new mechanic of cooperation works nicely though youre well and truly shafted without the medic in a hard game note to self must try not to control the game  must try not to control the game  let other people b play b i know its sacrilege and maybe because i played fi first but i would rather play forbidden island or forbidden desert over this too abstracted for me dislike the card sharing rules i feel i get less or equal for more time and complexity this may be the best cooperative game in existence its also one of the best games in existence period a totally different game on ipad pandemic is a great game with people that dont like to lose its not one i would play repetitively but its fun on an occasional game night i needed a cooperative game in my collection and im glad i got this one is is simple easy to teach appealing theme and playable by anyone in the family fun family game with lots of interaction and nobody gets hurt in the process you either win as a team or you will all loose you can actually change the game difficulty by adding epidemic cards it gets really nasty and stressing when playing with a higher difficulty and that tells you that you get caught up with the theme at first i loved this game so much that i wanted to buy it with all expansions however after some time it started to be too easy the tension is gone now but i still like to play it actually my friend bought legacy so im looking forward to play that one and well see regalo de cristina y joseba por mi cumplea os gracias es un cooperativo cuyo tema me encanta ojal  vea bastante mesa  a classic have grown fonder of it because of legacy and especially trying the survival format will proably rarely take this out to play vanilla unless with new players but i dont dislike it for that reason just a fun collaborative game for many ages great cooperative game pretty good as a coop game goes for some reason i fail to grasp the joy in coops that some do im gonna try with the family and see if it goes better j 14 r 44 pp tapete the gateway coop game love it it is nice to work together for a change can be negative if you have someone running the table i dont see the hoopla in this one its tedious for a coop and i wasnt that impressed with the player powers we had difficult to win unless we did something wrong a really cool game one of the very few cooperative games that really work still it gets repetitive after a few times good for introducing players to boardgaming first game we played with 5 people we lost very fast with two epidemic cards coming up within the first 3 rounds second game we played we won within 20 mins must have a bit of luck and strategy in order to win this game all in all we all enjoyed it signiert nice gateway game quite quick to set up and play fun game at first but after a few plays a pattern emerges that will almost always lead to a win really really really boring after a while i was falling asleep another heavily overrated shame better a book or a movie probably my favorite game an introduction to coop games and this one nails it perfectly balanced for my playing ability wishlist  my current hot game i currently want to play it all the time this borders on being a 10  ive played this a lot since i got it im going to bump it to a 10  other than a one year hiatus when i was working for wotc ive played this nearly every day at lunch  playing more pandemic legacy season 1 lately but still love the game when played with people of comparable skill level coop  meh i have only one game under my belt so take all this for what its worth ive played all the major coop games on the market lord of the rings shadows over camelot battlestar galactica and now pandemic of those games pandemic is probably the simplest design and the easiest to understand this is a good thing my friend who brought the game plays regularly with his children which is a good thing at the same time i think i prefer the linearity of lord of the rings over pandemic i think this is because i prefer the sense of handling this particular obstacle a given board in lotr then the firefighting of pandemic i also didnt find pandemic to be nearly as gutwrenching as other coops i dont know why maybe worldthreatening diseases dont trip my trigger as much as destroying the one ring or shepherding the human race to kobol a very fun coop game with some random elements every game will be different only downside is that when playing with a large group of people the game is more difficult and sometimes it feels like your turn could be hijacked by other players you do what they want you to do it has this strange attractiveness that makes you want to play again yet the play can be chaotic or you just try to mathemathically optimize your decisionsand it attracts all my bad luck one would not believe how unlucky my infection draws are lost our first game by one action ahhhhhhhhhhhh the first coop we played quarterbacking can be a problem a ton of fun and does not get played enough great cooperative game fun theme takes the edge off staying home with the flu you cant truly say youve played pandemic unless youve been able to lose the game before everyone gets to take a turn the unchallenged king of coop in my small collection bexpansionsb boardgameexpansionboardgameexpansion this is a single player puzzle game to me its really good at that though but im rating it on its overall 14 playability this cooperative game can be a lot of fun to play it just needs more roles that you can play only played once  need to play more to give a fair score trade snydepels k bt brugt 50 kr a good coop but it can feel scripted depending on the roles present  lebryants top games of all time    top 74  rating  4  overall plays  1   top 74  rating  4  overall plays  1   top 67  rating  4  overall plays  1 compelling you just keep going back for more an enjoyable cooperative romp quick playing challenging and fun i really like the cooperative nature of this game gameplay is simple and yet the game is engaging and fun well worth playing still havent solved this game my daughter 6yo loves this coop game its really nice how the difficulty can be adjusted to challenge us both she plays as the scientist and its great for her to see how cool science and medicine can be as well as learn about world geography fantastic game wish i would have gotten it sooner bon jeu coop ratif o  lon cherche    radiquer la pand mie the coop game that i turn to above most others love the theme the mechanics and ability of varying difficulty though sometimes its not about if you can win but how fast you can lose purchase on  october too legit to quit never gets old something is wrong with me though i think losing is more fun great game with a very clever mechanism for epidemics my first and best recommendation for a coop game good game as a coop rated a 7 or 8 great game solo rated a 9 challenging to beat with different difficulty levels great game to give nongamers a taste of whats available these days the more i play it the more i like it  no game is the same and the suspense is always high i really like this game though it does have some problems that keep it from hitting the table too often weve found that one player or a few will usually take the lead and start telling everyone else what to do on their turn usually by the end of the game one or more of the players are really just along for the ride i dont mind taking a backseat though if everyone else is having fun fun fast cooperative game that has a great theme and is a solid gateway game the limited cards and counters bound the game length but constrain actions and game configuration too with other mathematically inclined people it starts to appear like a statistical puzzle game with a single general strategy theres no reason to play this outside of the  games of legacy you play every year or so probably the best coop game though its got the right mix of simple ruleslimited action tree variable player powers and difficulty kind of sparked this revival of cooperative games very wellcrafted i had this for awhile before i had the nerve to introduce this my spouse as she doesnt like cooperative games we played at the easiest level and drew role cards a couple of times until we got roles we thought would work we tried to prevent outbreaks over actually curing the diseases and barely won thankfully it was a hit and my spouse is probably willing to play again i almost wonder if i am playing this correctly it gets such high ratings but it is not a game that i nor my game players really feel passionately about pretty enjoyable coop game looking to get the expansions a really great cooperative game trade interest for this is not very high i would most likely only look for a trade up pretty good abstraction of arkham horror excellent game design and concept unfortunately the sterile uninteresting components do little to set an adequate atmosphere for an otherwise really good game great game the whole family really enjoys this cooperative game fun fast game easy to learn within one or two rounds among friends and family who want to succeed together this can be enjoyable played and was left wondering what the big deal was especially when compared to lord of the rings at its best it felt like a lot of the experienced people saying do this so we can do this other thing might be good to play as a family game but otherwise seemed too light without a lot of meaningful decisions to make its a really good game though i prefer the legacy version of it as it poses a bigger challenge this is prolly mine and my wifes favorite game to play together extremely difficult to beat but good fun with the right type of people stay clear from an overcontrolling group it is a bit dull mechanically but the theme saves it plus you can pretend that you fight any disease you like not really a fan i know people love it im just not that into it from my experience its quarterbacking  the game but it has been fun from both sides alpha and nonalpha player so whatever works great game but did noot impress the family im beginning to believe that coops are not for us dobry  redniak best cooperative game i know solid game super fun to solo but i dont love it i would play it but not love it a really interesting and very different feeling coop game i love how the difficulty just keeps ramping up throughout the game and the agonizing decisions about which cards to keep especially since the cards can be used in several different ways the effects of an epidemic card and the individualized player powers from the role cards make the game feel really thematic  honestly much more than i expected i do feel like some of the role cards are clearly better than others but theyre all useful the production quality is really fantastic as well i love the dark color scheme on the map and the transparent plastic disease cubes the outbreakinfection markers are some of the nicest plastic tokens ive ever seen in a game i love the replayability of this game its coop so there is not tension with competitive people there is luck strategy variable difficulties its a great game digital  physical copy wife and i enjoy playing 2 person like the fact you can change the difficulty level and to choose different character roles a lot of people love this game i liked it a lot too but after 10 games it gets really boring and mundane i think pandemic is an overrated game brant still one of my alltime favorite coop games that being said i havent played a ton of coop games but this one will always have a special place gut problematisch wenn der erfahrenste spieler die f hrung der gruppe  bernimmt und f r die anderen spieler mitentscheidet alpha gamer syndrom bei ausgewogener spielerfahrung sehr gutes koop sonst eher ein verkapptes solo spiel aufgesetztes setting im prinzip ein kartensammelspiel im not sure why the game comes marked as 24 players this game works just as well playing solo as any other cooperative game when playing solo you will need to control at least 2 characters though my favorite game of all time i love the base game and all of the expansions and spin offs i will buy anything pandemic themed out there its cooperative interesting and fun pandemic is one of the greatest designed games i have ever played co ops are hit or miss with me but matt leacock really knows how to dial them up the so called ai of the game which is really just drawing form a deck of cards works sooooo brilliant its one of the most fair ais ive seen in co op gaming the epidemics being shuffled evenly into the deck makes the game even more balanced you know when your about to draw one because you havent drawn one in a while or maybe you drawn two in a row and you know you have a break the variability which is created from the epidemic deckroles you play with is amazing every game is different there are so many different strategies you can go with do you do rush to find a cure go heavy on building research stations early trading i can go on but man is this game amazing bobby zach cool idea hard to beat but pretty fun if in the right mood b st p  4 spelare gave 775 originally but after further play find it to be solvable and lost only due to unlucky draws 5 2  4 players 15 gateway pretty fun coop i actually liked it better than expected and the theme worked well theme is bland enough for anyone to play and is supported by the tension of propogating plagues excellent jeu coop ratif la lutte contre les maladies est toujours tr s tendue il faut prendre les bonnes d cisions la victoire ou la d faite se joue toujours   un poil very fun easy to teach an excellent introductory game great game played my first solo game today and cant wait to play it with our regular friends sleeved in clear plastic sleeves bought it for a friend now i own it as well i like this game a lot perhaps its because of the use of map in a game that is not an area control game its important to play where one person doesnt boss the others around games that go like this arent fun i dont get all of the hype the game is enjoyable but nothing special the theme was weak its just a set collecting game with some bells and whistles the cooperative element works well but i see this game getting boring after a few plays anniversery edition imparato e giocato sold  solod  best coop game ive played appropriate for the times my first leaving gift from student services finally played solo  two handed and survived by curing all 4 diseases keep board 24 rating will increase as i play more the game is quite hard i dont love pandemic it seems too linear it lends itself to one person dominating the others and telling them what to do not my favorite the complexity of this game is easily overlooked because of the new mechanics that it brings to the gaming industry i ve never had so much fun loosing and i love the fresh concept of beating a game as part of a team rather than competing against everyone good game and probably should be rated higher but for some reason theres something about it im not fond of i cant put my finger on this is a puzzlesolving game for only one solo player but it is disguised as a collaborative multyplayer game dont believe it is the only way of playing it is leaving a single player take all decisions an exemplar design failure cracking game whats nice is that the women who sometimes come into our games group request this one and seem to enjoy it i love the cooperation element and the edginess of it its easy to lose so youve got to keep your wits about you complete nice quick game with a very morbid outcome most of the time adjustable difficulty is nice good as both a gateway and for gamers as long as you dont have an alpha gamer at the table game that got me back into board gaming great theme easily accessible solo 1st play introductory game  3 roles won on the last turn 2nd play introductory game  3 roles won on the last turn 3rd play normal game  3 roles lost needed one more turn 4th play normal game  3 roles lost needed two more turns 5th

2nd play normal game  2 roles won on the last turn cooperative losefest great game you are a team of people trying to save the world from a shitstorm of disease the disease wins most game easy for people to play for the first time as you can be coached by your teammates this is a good coop definitely blew me away when i first discovered it but every game feels the same and it has been replaced by dead men tell no tales for me i have not tried the expansions yet i hear they are great but the base game itself gets repetitive i am hoping the expansions bring it back from the dead for me really fun coop game and trying to race against the game to beat it pretty light and a great quick game starting to fade a little at 10 plays this game peaked at a 9 for me team game check fun check quick check i really like this game and will probably make it my next purchase this game continues to be a family favorite rules and game mechanics are easy to grasp after one openhand play through this game travels with us to relatives houses and is always a favorite forbidden desert and defenders of the realm do this better no dice here just running around and cube pushing also too easy cooperative game work together with unique roles to treat infections and cure diseases across the globe nice component quality and good mechanics with the infection deck small amount of push your luck a good cooperative game if everyone gets involved one player can dominate decisions which becomes frustrating when playing with new players as it essentials feels like a solo experience i have enjoyed pandemic but will be looking for a different cooperative feel in the future player count 3 run time 60mins 4 3 3  faq    httpsseesaawikijpwpandemicboardgame 7 8   7  probably the best cooperative ever and one of those game where i really really feel the theme and the anguish of the ticking time fun fast paced keeps everybody involved the only reason i havent rated it higher is its simple nature orlando is suffers from alphaplayer thats me syndrome big time so i dont like to play with newbies great with my wife though girlfriends favourite game easily in my top three for coop games it has a harrowing theme and tense gameplay i love the cooperative gameplay in pandemic the increase in challenge through added epidemics becomes very daunting but much more approachable when its sink or swim for all a coop puzzle stare at the board and find the right answer but together id play this more often if anyone in my group liked it my issue is the lack of tension as with most coops space alert solves this problem and is a much better teambuilding exercise in my opinion its a blastmore coop games are needed in this world this game i have played a few times and i have enjoyed it definitely depends on the number of players and which characters are in play on if you can win the game its just sotense i may eventually bring this up closer to a ten for the simple fact that it is easy yet super strategicand cheap i also like being able to work with others every once in a while instead of constantly playing games where i have to conquer them hard pretty easy for people to learn but we have been getting our butts kicked still the coop aspect is neat in us a wellbalanced cooperative game that is not too stacked against the players but is not a pushover either fun coop game entry game is a bit easy though extremely popular coop but ive never been very fond of it too easily taken over by the alpha gamer can be fun with the right group but the inconsistency lowers its score pandemic is perhaps one of the best cooperative games perhaps it is like a great solitaire game where one must respond to a carddeckgenerated set of circumstances  in this case  globallynetworked viruses special abilities and basetobase travel make the struggle great i still must die several deaths trying superginormouslylegendary level we have so much fun with pandemic honestly we like knowing that we have a good chance of winning but i also look forward to adding increased difficulty with expansions this is our first cooperative game and it certainly wont be our last take my rating with a grain of salt i dislike coops i dislike the theme which seems pasted on anyway in so many ways this is clearly not a game created for me other people seem to enjoy it good for them my low rating reflects that i very much disliked this game the mechanics are actually quite good but i find the game dry and not very fun   pandemic on the brink im so tired of this game but my boyfriend loves it so here we are nc outstanding coop my wife and i love pandemic a great game always under pressure at some point in the game and the roles in play can have a big impact on how well you do its very fun and well built however i tend to find that the optimal strategy is to just do what the most experienced player says this is one of the best cooperative games ive ever played keeps one on the edge of their seat played a few times already plays fast and it is addictive already won in the easy version in a 2 player game moving to normal play 24 players 45 minutes cooperative really good coop game but is better with more players 25 players expansions on the brink in the lab got this for christmas  i would like to get this for my healthcare classroom with high school students but the family likes it too much my son got addicted to the fanmade ipad version of it he has played with all the various roles and events i think the base game is too easy for him we have the legacy game for home i am bringing this back to the classroom i also picked up a second copy i think i need 5 total for the class always looking for used ones there are better coop games but not many really great coop game nice for couple laminated i loved this game and played it all the time after a while i got a little bored as the game became easy to win however with the on the brink expansion this is a lot of fun and very challenging again great fun hard to beat with two players great game that plays more like a puzzle with the suspense escalating beautifully throughout the game like most good coops it can be more fun to lose than win but setting up a well executed win a turn before defeat is really fun easily one of the most recommendable games in this hobby i dont like that when it is your turn 3 other players suggest what you can do i cant think well at the same time plus its a matter of set collection this is not so thematic in my memory this is set collection with lots of identical cubes everywhere i liked the streamlined rules though im not really a fun of coop games but for a coop this is quite good the fast tempo helps a lot and the theme works still this is essentially a solo game great coop game its simple enough to be played by young and new players making it a great gateway game but its also depth enough to grab strategy players wanting to save the world this was my first cooperative game and still is my favorite game to play with my gaming group i find the game dull and lacking in engagement once you are playing the game well your decisionmaking ability is locked into just responding to the board condition with no reward for creative or innovative play there is no riskreward in the game that is of any consequence once you play the game well you are essentially watching things unfold to see if you win losing is often out of your control and with experienced players has nothing to do with the players just luck still good fast cooperative game but it is getting old already concept is quite easy to learn good for new gamers there is quite a lot of cooperative games published last years which goes further to deep mechanics where pandemic is little bit shallow i am impressed with the design not going to be a favorite but im happy to play it when it comes out when first bought we thought it was amazing and it is a challenging game the main downside of cooperative play is that one person can dominate especially with newer players some of the roles are far better than others and they arent completely balanced the expansion with the bioterrorist can mitigate this as the most experienced player can play this role i find the special powers to orient the game too much this is not the case that much with games like forbidden desert or forbidden island also afeter a play i dont feel the urge at all to play again anytime soon weve played this so much our cards are very worn its about time to order replacement cards  well be putting the cards in sleeves next time a nice puzzle to solve after playing it a lot adding on the brink helped keep it interesting cooperative defeat the virus great family game my 4 and 6 year old love the drama of it i love this game it can be very hard especially if were playing with expansions game produces many emotions in players mostly negative ones which is very good because global pandemic is not supposed to be funny you never know what game will throw at you when you think youre doing great job with stoping pandemic the game punches you in the face and basically destroying everything youve done so far cooperation and synergy between players is required to win in this game   there are not very many good cooperative games that i have come across which has struck me like this one has well done and fun to play just great im not a big fan of coop games yet sold a great coop game that quickly starts to feel worn out unfortunately 24 60m perfect for solitude evenings cant wait for on the brink in polish closet theres a reason this was 1 for so many years i love coop i love the theme this game just works im looking forward to buying the expansions and legacy versions when we feel ready currently we are still very content with the base game expansion on the brink classic coop game a must have 7 with expansions 6 base game solid coop game but shadowed for me by the legacy versions at this point 41 on my top 100 games of all time  other coops are starting to replace this for me as i rarely find myself wanting to play it but i played this one a lot when i was new to the hobby so i have a lot of nostalgic and recognition for what it brought to the gaming industry i like the on the brink expansion a lot too i havent tried any of the others pandemic legacy was beyond amazing acquired christmas   gift from dad and janetta  the game feels more like a puzzle to me than anything else the means of increasing the difficulty of the game appeals to me less than flash point fire rescue i appreciate the randomness makes it feel less like a group puzzle i will likely never play this if sentinels of the multiverse is in the room pandemic is one of my top few favorites it is variable enough that it is different every time and challenging enough that we rarely win i really wanted to like this game after reading about it online our group just find it falls flat sold colorffbrutally unforgiving if played on heroic difficulty really wish this was more complex eg viruses can evolve gain resistance etc etccolor sleeved and organized classic coop i have played this game i enjoy it great game one of the few that sucked me into the hobby for a game with a theme this one is a bit too abstract for me  ive been jaded by ameritrash components and euro wooden bits that arent cubes p but i will gladly play whenever someone requests it pandemic er i mine  jne blandt de bedste samarbejdsspil et spil der som oftest er sp ndende fra start til slut g r det helt galt slutter spillet ofte hurtigt n r man vinder er det selv de sidste ture inden det lykkes altid med en sikker forvisning om at meget endnu kan n  at g  galt mekanisk er spillet meget elegant og som oftest pr senteres man for interessante valg skal jeg rette en kritik imod pandemic vil det v re at det m ske er en smule for abstrakt a great coop game if you are a fan then i recommend playing with either expansions or legacy pandemic can get repetitive if just playing the base garage include in pl s1 i have played 3 times so far each time with enthusiasts for the game while i had fun i was left worrying that something was missing that we were just playing against a random system and that one person could have done it more efficiently than four this is a feeling i get playing most cooperative games except shadows over camelot with its traitor such a fun puzzle i enjoy it solo as well bupdateb i traded this away because i prefer pandemic iberia i was finding myself scratch during this game marred by the fact that there is usually a correct thing to do and so one player ends up dominating discussion is generally trivial and the amount of strategy minimal enjoyable but only infrequently everyone seems to love this game but me im just ok with it the first playing this game i was hooked i love coop games like this and it always feels like a challenge no matter which difficulty to start on i recommend this game to everyone i talk to the coop game presumably one day this will be the grandfather of coop games also like agricola is very inoffensive in its theme great but gets repetitive fun but out of 4 plays weve never even come close to winning the difficulty level could really discourage new players close to our most played game its a top choice for 2 players in our group really got the group into playing cooperative games i personally liked it but when i got on the brink i absolutely loved it its another one of those gems really good coop game great game for couples new to gaming brilliant intense my first introduction to a cooperative game and we really need to cooperate to win iok  will play if in the moodi after playing pandemic legacy i now see how much variety was missing from the base pandemic game on the brink saves the whole bundle by giving some interesting options to a nice gateway game c rating history 22 jan   6 17 plays 28 mar   7 c old beat up copy i like co ops and i like this theme love the game and recommend it for anyone very easy to learn and tons of fun to play only loses marks from me because once you kind of suss the system out it does get pretty easy to win this is such a great game i think it is great for all ages at is touches on learning locations of major cities around the world and doesnt have the cut throat feel of non coop games this is one that is constantly requested on my board game nights 4 player game down to last card and 10 minutes of calculating last 4 moves for the win absolutely gripping and trilling pandemic legacy season 1 here we come prior to  100 plays est if catan carcassonne and ticket to ride introduced me to modern hobby gaming pandemic is the game that officially made me take the deep plunge shortly followed by another masterpiece i discovered race for the galaxy into its sweet sweet bliss pandemic is and will probably always be the cooperative game by which all others are compared and ultimately judged and i feel this way primarily because of how well pandemic streamlines the depthtocomplexity ratio as well as how well the difficulty can be scaled based on group and player count additionally the mechanisms of the game remain intuitive and simplistic yet come together in a way thats deeply thematic and puzzly rewarding both the new and experienced players at the table theres such a brilliant blend of luck and skill as well as tactics and strategy here and the epidemic system just works so well at keeping escalating pressure on the players throughout the game the base game is still compelling after all these years especially with 6 epidemic cards shuffled in and the system works so perfectly with all of its expansions each which further develop out one portion of the game to be more rich and often challenging pandemic just is a modern classic in every regard and should be played by anyone seriously interested in the hobby while some might suspect ive played the game to death this actually isnt the case and id happily revisit this one especially with expansions just about any time an absolute masterpiece keeper i dont know what it is but this game just doesnt feel fun to me i can see why people love it and how it can be a great game with the family but it doesnt scratch that gaming itch i happen to enjoy the new coat of paint that pandemic received with this edition the new roles are interesting as well upgraded meeples and research stations from meeple source fantastic coop game with very cool mechanics think its great that it can be played solo as well super fun to play once maybe twice then feels a bit shallow much respect to this game for setting up panicinducing scenarios most of the time it feels a little too easy but there are great punctuated oh crap moments love the pieces to this game the art is good just wanted more depth and challenge or ingenuity in the mechanics a safe game to play with board game noobs and engaging enough for nerds which is i guess why it succeeded the way it did respect 1st edition copy my wifes favorite game good condition complete expansions on the brink upgrades sleeved great game playable at different difficulties love this have graduated to legacy though i enjoy games where it is possibly to win without the game decimating you and without having someone quarterback how it plays i never could get into this game it always seemed like you were going to lose even from an easy set up beginning 1 with pandemic the cure i truly have no desire to ever play this again better and more fast paced than i thought like it way more than forbidden island alpha gamer syndrome alert though i will play this mostly solo  play this solo and on app edit and with my partner on the beautiful 10th anniversary edition d 16 24 original and state of emergency 25 on the brink 16 in the lab ages 8 hnp fun truly cooperative game not sure there is a alot of longevity there after the first few games you really just play through to see if the cards are going to let you win or not kind of like patience good to find the right strategy as in many cooperative games bad to decide a person who will decide the next move or let there be many many voices all over that might work for a party game but i think its totally not a party game always devolves into one person with the perfect plan if you deviate from the perfect plan then everyone looses solo such a great coop game and my first introduction to the genre i still love to play it and i love how often we dont win coop games should be hard have played this a bunch and really enjoy it played to death but still our favourite cooperative game   bcn im a fan of base pandemic but pandemic legacy is far superior havent tried any of the pandemic expansions a cooperative popular light game i guess i have a need for this sort of thing the game was actually better than i expected after 2 plays at agos con ive only played a couple of games but im really enjoying it it might be a little too much of a cooperative game for my tastes but i guess it just adds to the allforone atmosphere im starting to think its impossible to win but i think a lot of that is the element of luck involved in the drawing of cards i tend to like the fact that its unpredictable but i think some would dislike that whateverid rather have a game thats too hard than one thats too easy i think this game is almost played out for me just won a fiveplayer six epidemic game fairly handily still fun but wouldnt be my first choice of a game at this point taught a group of eleven yearolds this game and they absolutely loved it they really enjoyed the team aspect of it they found the experience of working together in a board game very unique and different from what they were had previously experienced wife rating 9 difficult to get to table as appears coop not that popular with my familypartner would highly recommend anyway though  with a group that works together even if debating the best course of action this game is incredible every card draw is tense and every move walks the fine line between success and failure defeat encourages you to try again victory encourages you to see if you can keep the streak going i played this 7 times in two days with the same group and we never got tired of it  after having a lot of plays in just a few other coop games i can see that there is much less cooperation involved in pandemic yes each player has their own specialized roles that help the group but the only thing that can be accomplished on your own is removing disease cubes a minor task overall because of this the game doesnt come down to working together so much as putting everyones ideas to a vote i have to lower my rating from a 9 to a 6 since its no longer my first choice in coop games cool game to play great coop experience looking forward to play many more rounds of this game the different characters that you can play in the game are also cool they definitely put some effort in building this game i like also the cubes in the game good quality will think about buying a expansion for this game nice light coop game like the different roles if you like it you should try pandemic legacy very few coop games will get a good rating from me they are just not my style the most elegant and interesting cooperative game for me and my family works great for all ages easy to explain i dont particularly like cooperative game mainly because i get ocd with people doing the optimal things on their turn and give too much advice to the others i dont like that i do this but i cant seem to help myself very good wont ever play again after playing legacy season 1 one of my wifes absolute favorites a true classic a thematic tight coop game that scales well falkon lacerta love the theme and coop play high quality board and pieces actual game play is a little overrated yepi said itoverrated 15 pandemic on the brink pandemic in the lab pandemic state of emergency 76 24 players best 4 45 min this was the first game we got after playing settlers of catan for 5 years our game group didnt care for the coop aspect of it were too competitive but playing with kids is great i normally play with my 9 year old may  a fun challenging cooperative game the pressure of coordinating actions and movement across the map is very thematic would definitely love to try the other versions and expansions someday first play through this is now a must have i avoided it due to owning flash pointfire rescue but they are very dissimilar we won t play this again this is one of those games that just proves that i don t like cooperative games i find the mechanisms in this game wonderfully refreshing it is really a different game from the other games in my collection and i enjoy it every time i play it win or lose zona 4 interesting coop that is essentially a puzzle havent gotten bored of it yet el mejor coop que he jugado hasta el momento recomendado tanto para principiantes como experto de los juegos de mesa de lo mejor que he jugado pandemic  on the brink  in the lab ive found this game very easy to explain and teach to games and nongames alike its very easy to play and but satisfyingly hard to master the theme of attempting to control infections and rid the world of diseases is probably the best in any game its both original and something actually important in the real world unfortunately theres a lot of luck in the final outcome but i think thats a common feature of most cooperative games the important thing is that i and my fellow players have usually enjoyed playing it i like the theme dramatic and cool way the diseases spread this is a very well constructed game very replayable since the movement optimization is different each time the length of the game is just right and its very easy to teach and understand the theme is reflected in the mechanics but i still find it rather generic and dull one of the best mechanics in board games  simple but brilliant one of my first games but still on the run hard but very satisfying telem vel finally this is mine exploring great abstract puzzle game fun to play as well as a fast paced coop the thematic is to this day extremly relevant really amazing and fun game i love the mechanics and the theme of the game its nice to play alongside my friends to try to take down all the diseases it is always a blast when i bring this game out will play anytime just fun even though we seldom win this game builds with so much suspense that it makes immediate replay in spite of repeated losses fun the actionpoint variable player power and card shuffling randomness mechanic make this game what it is its excellent and should stand the test of time or spawn newer revisions of its mechanics in differentlythemed games or both we really love this game now it is a difficult game to win but can be highly addictive it is pretty easy to learn and i love the cooperative game play everyone playing to beat the game and not each other superhard at first but then you learn it and will win very frequently weve enjoyed this one the coop nature of the game makes this a little more accessible than some others s a cooperative game that offers a nice puzzle to throw your brain at has just enough randomness to make each game different while ensuring that you never feel cheated by the ai can suffer from alpha player syndrome but thats a problem among most cooperative board games a family favourite hyperbalanced and very challenging great cooperation game a fun coop game raised the rating on this since getting the on the brink expansion has alot more variety now with the expansion and the added roles make it more fun as well easy to learn short undertandable rules quick set up my preferred cooperative game for hard corps experienced players the expansions add depth and complexity at the expense of making it more difficult for nonboardgamers to get into it i prefer the elegance of the base game but do add in some aspects from on the brink seldom used and now never use in the lab even with hard corps devotees of the game i do not like the return it brings on yet another level of complexity layered into a refined excellent game to begin with i modified the game for up to 8 people adding new roles from other pandemic expansions and online suggestions and added a nuclear option to save humanity a very good and simple coop game more accessible and less fiddly then lord of the rings everyone has different powers and each must be used well and in conjunction with the other players very elegant rule set zman has really put together a cool coop experience and it can be played in 45 minutesit can definitely suffer from the onepersonrunsthegame problem i suggest playing with closed hands resist showing your cards to each other app version             our familys most played game  we love it it has the most exciting end game to any weve played the tension really ratchets up at some point well def get the legacy version great cooperative strategypuzzle game one of the best in its genre i use pandemic as a gateway for new gamers it also seems to stand the test of time for experienced gamers  18 one of my favorite cooperative game the base game its to simple and i bought pandemic iberia that taking the legacys games out of the list it s the best pandemic game out there you can literally lose at the end of the first players first turn or you can get really lucky and get a good setup in your game too much luck too prone to alpha gaming with alexia ot own on the brink exp what a difficult game to try to beat our merry band of 3 cdc workers cured two of the infections and were about to cure a third when it all collapsed on us in south america if i recall correctly not a fan of cooperative games where we bandytogether to beat the system took awhile for us to get to playing this exactly right we were doing the infection rate and medic role incorrectly but once we figured it out this played quite enjoyably with a nice tenseness intro games so far were still playing this as the beginner game as each time i have played it the people playing it has changed 18c nice cooperative game a real race against the clock we played the medium version and didnt win very nice coop game very tense cccoa a 3 or 4 players syd thanksgiving fun classic coop game this really showed my wife and i what cooperative games could do i originally owned the first edition but after receiving an expansion for the second game i splurged on getting the 2nd edition that really made the game even more fun the classic coop game in my mind a well designed game that has a great theme and approachable for new gamers new to coops the one flaw is that the puzzle has a very mathy static feel to it meaning it plays out in mostly the same way every time unique game requiring players to all cooperate rather than compete against each other the playing style can get somewhat mechanical once the players know all the tricks for winning the game amazingly fun best so far as a twoplayer climbing up my top 10 very quickly i cant remember the last time this was mentioned on a gameday so im mostly playing it solo these days still great whenever i play it  update after playing so many other pandemics in the past couple of years this one felt a little stale coming back to it still had fun but my rating has dropped a bit expansions pandemic on the brink 3august   faith wanted this game its an uneven game most times thrilling and very exciting but sometimes if you have bad luck it becomes a little tiring i like theme of this game very much it has all the flaws of cooperative games so if you dont like them you wont be a fan of pandemic almost every aspect of this game i love the varied roles and difficulty levels make this game always a favorite in my house had a stint where this was the most played game in my collection by far it sparked more of an interest in other games a great cooperative game that you can coast to a win or lose in only a few turns a good cooperative game feels more like a team building exercise than a game good for folks who like puzzle solving sleeved rik corlyn downloads  team game that we got to play with the kids works well and was enjoyable a great way to mix up the table dynamic quickly gets stressful in a good way sold my partner does not like coops so this was no longer getting played fun coop game i love the theme and the mission of saving the world from the diseases sometimes the game feels a little to calculated as if you are counting the cards to see if you will be able to make a certain move or stop the disease from spreading i am very unlucky when i play this game most of the time and i have drawn an epidemic card on my first turn the last two games i played my brotherinlaw absolutely loves this game so i recently got him the expansion which will be exciting to try so this is usually the game we play when i get to see him update sold 619 wonderful coop game very difficult to win and very addictive sort of ran into the problem of one vocal person running the entire game but as long as we can avoid that this is a great coop first time i played this game i hated it thought it was absolutely wretched now it is one of my favourites you really need the right group to play any social deduction came i never thought id say it but this has actually topped the resistance for me as a social deduction party game the amount of fun per unit time in this game is unrivalled secret santa present  excellent cooperative game solitaire is also good as well enjoyable as a solo surprisingly a game that you can play with all kind of people it is so so hard but always you want some more the theme fits perfect the mechanism of the spreading viruses are great and it is tense all the time only with team spirit you can win the harder levels after many plays still we always have a blast playing this one save the world but mostly die trying  i know i m in the minority but i just don t find this game fun there are better coops out there the best cooperative game there is great role synergy and players have to coordinate their moves to win the game other coops tend to lack these features pandemic probably gets the most play in the household either 2p or with friends also good to fit into a lunchtime session where it caused an epidemic and some colleagues also bought it for home just got the meeplesource characters to add more fun and flavour well i have finally found a coop game that i enjoy pandemic does it for me because it is short and because it is hard those two facts will keep me coming back for more at least for the foreseeable future this will be the first coop game to join my collection of approx 200 titles devir lisboa sleeved euro coop game with excelent game mechanics that i feel to short though my daughter loves the legacy series i enjoy this game but the theme is darker than i really would like to play when forbidden island came out i found it much more appealing sleeved yellowblue great coop quick fun easy to teach i love it my husband hates it so i only get to play over at friends houses score solo game decent introductory game due to coop mechanic i was highly anticipating this game as many reviewers praise this game very highly yet it seemed very mundane to me it really came down to trading cards with colours on them to other people or running around destroying cubes cooperative games really lack the conflicting decisions that i really crave in most games since it is a cooperative game and you can easily split tasks between players maybe im just not a cooperative gamer i dont even see the appeal in playing it again really theres no diversity to the game other than where the certain coloured cubes will appear next nice evolution of a familiar concept great production values a cooperative game i actually like great beginner cooperative game it requires some courtesy from everyone to play one person can definitely take control of the game and tell everyone what to do which makes the experience boring you have to work as a team and allow all people to contribute equally i love this game my kids love this game it is a game worth loving solid components tense gameplay great replayability this game is a must have in my home lovely lean awesome coop fun this game is really well designed has a large gorgeous board and very nice components it plays really smoothly and really provides a lot of tension as you struggle to keep the viruses under control unfortunately i am not a big fan of coop games i find once you play them a couple of times additional plays feel repetitive ill hang on to this game since i think it is so well designed and it will serve as the coop game i will rely on if i find myself needing or wanting to play one update i never feel like playing coops so i sold this to a friend one of the first games that come to mind in the coop genre can suffer from alpha player syndrome but can still be an interesting puzzle with a risk management element to figure out ie should we treat city a or city b this turn to try to prevent an outbreak from happening definitely not required but the on the brink expansion adds a lot of very nice stuff to mix with the base game after youve won some standardlevel games to keep things from being predictable i love this game even when i think i am tired of it when someone else wants to play 5 seconds into the game the love affair is back there is something absolutely compelling about this game i love the coop aspect it is really hard but not ghost stories impossible you can play it with new gamers and old it is just a great goto game easily one of the best cooperative games on the market ive never had more fun losing a game in my life donated to el gremio palafrugell was fun but not enough to buy maybe if imogen likes it a lot porto only own the android app currently  a coop or cooperative wtf so wait were not playing against eachother were playing together against the game bullocks i was very skeptical at first but the one play i played did sway me so it seems that the game is tough at first but after learning how to cooperate you get better and then can increase the difficulty accordingly sweet i heard that the creater created this game becasue he wanted more games that he could play with his wife great idea i recomend this game on the basis that its different fun and cooperative i also heard that some couples play agricola solomode cooperatively i will be trying that out hopefully really soon i could play this again but hopefully it will be at the gaming group when my wifes there i dont want to buy it unless she likes it and the upfront rules are a little much to get past but by no means difficult i added this game to my collection in november  its a classic i have a lovehate relationship with it i played it once and thought it was too easy however id like to give it another try ive bought sold and traded it like 4 times zagra bym z kim  kto potrafi wygra  w temacie  theres nothing in this game very low level coop most of the time it is really one way to be max efficient and win this game really overhyped game played it a few times it just got old fast and had no interest in buying expansions etc     too light and too scripted a preprogrammed set of events does not make a game this is a fun cooperative game that is good for families with on the brink this game is every good thing ive read about it it is such a great cooperative adventure and the theme feels quite real so that we all feel like heroes whether we win or lose i love cooperative games and this is one of the best doesnt get played as much as it used to but still one of our favorite coops great coop game though can tend to be dominated by one person in some instances as coordination is important still a great challenge that can result into some exciting down to the wire endings i love the theme i really feels like a race against time to eradicate nasty flesheating puking death before it consumes the world around you however this game is a puzzle and you have to play it cooperatively that means it has two big strikes against it 1 dominating players will end up telling you what to do 2 they are frequently right there is usually one best option to take and if you dont do it or maybe you didnt see it at first the game is over its just over and its suddenly your fault that aunt minnie in chicago died on the toilet along with half the population of north america similar to castle panic forbidden desert defenders of the realm and other cooperative games if you dont do the next right thing youre toast or in this case a quivering feces soiled vomitcovered invalid who just lost the game for everyone because you wanted to take that flight to buenos aries to cure the black plague who knew the red captain tripps virus was about to break out in moscow we knew you moron and you didnt listen to us get out okay maybe we were harsh with you but this game does create a real sense of tension and when outbreaks occur you almost can hear the screaming humanity its difficult to win but early on you will win a few times  mostly because you were playing it wrong that happens a lot there are so many house rules for pandemic im sure zman games is trying to come up with a vaccine for them it can get a little fiddly especially if you forget your characters power or dont follow the outbreak rules just right since it is very hard to win i think thats where all the house rules pop up this is often the first coop game many new players experience and the concept of losing as a team with the game lurching to sudden halt realy surprises them look at everyones reaction on will wheatons table top when they loose pandemic look at morgan webb yes lets do that for a while mmmmm morgan webb id like to buy the on the brink expansion but i just dont get to play this game enough to justify the expense if this is the first game you use to expose your friends to cooperatives then explain to them about the fun of playing without actually winning it may go down as less of a bitter pill when they loose its a great game many similar coop games have come since but this still holds up 5 plays having played similar coop games forbidden island and desert also by matt leacock flash point fire rescue that race against time and cascading crisis i both appreciate how well pandemic sets up crisis and i miss the rich detail and character of the other games pandemic just feels very dry the turns sort of blend together its good but even though forbidden island is much simpler at my house we pull it off the shelf much more often lightness 1heaviness 5 rating 3 acquired  through  inventoried ok sleeves mayday premium game is fun for about 5 tries and then it just gets to be draining and samey one player tends to just make decisions for everyone else and wellnot much else to say get it if your a party gamer otherwise not recommended a really great game i specially like the mechanic where you shuffle the discard pile and put it on top of the deck it gets really tense and sometimes we win or lose by the skin of our teeth i hope i find that red cube that the cat stole sleeved impossibile giocarci una sola partita paradossalmente il maggior divertimento lo si ottiene quando si perde rimuginando per giorni su quale sia stata la mossa sbagliata a determinare la sconfitta eccellente non vedo lora di provare le espansioni one of the best last games published a well done cooperative game that works perfectly all the players feel the tension to find the cures the cooperation betwen then is inevitable an absolute classic and one of the best gateways into the hobby the base game can get boring on replays but expansions can easily remedy that state of emergency and in the lab are great id call pandemic the cooperative game that all other cooperative games should be compared to it has an excellent game mechanic that works well with any number of players it has a good theme and it gets every player involved but somehow i just cant shake the feeling that it could be even better and more engaging pandemic is a great game that could be a bit more immersive to really get me going i recommend this game to everybody who likes cooperative games this is a great stressinducing game this might be one of the first coop games ive played aside from the mind and i was surprised it is tough to beat but rewarding nonetheless the best cooperative game i have played o6stay app volledig a big one for me and the wife we have probably 30 plays of this before i started coming to the geek expansions really stretched the life out on this game great coop game that is always a hit and a blast to play no matter who you are playing with its official  i finally found a game that my wife has been begging to play not only that but i love it too we have a new 1 for couples this is the gold standard of coop games the main problem getting it to the table is pandemic legacy after playing that its very hard to step back to the base game update in fact i brought out the base game with the same group i played season 1 pandemic with and it did indeed feel very bland and ive reduced my rating slightly because of that cooperative games are fun but i think there are better ones fun to play with my boardgame group always exciting to see if we win or lose i would suggest this game up and down for new coop players hugely enjoyable cooperative game always a bit tense as youre never quite sure if you have the viruses under control due to a not excessive dose of luck the different roles chosen randomly make the game very different from play to play so youre forced to adapt strategies accordingly i love cooperative games that work the mechanic of putting the infection discard pile on top of the draw pile is brilliant and really creates a tense atmosphere wife favorite bkeepb a coop game where you try to prevent the world from being overrun by diseases fun but very challenging we usually lose but always have a good time doing it  pandemic is the first unique cooperative game to own with its ai deck the game is unpredictable when and where the disease will emerge roles are all unique with other peoples help and planning disease can be eradicated despite its high replayability the base game gets stale after you beat it many times thats when you buy rest of expansions to increase the games replayability highly very fun game another game i burnt out on pretty quickly im not one to try and solve games but i found that i managed it anyway playing this this game now feels a lot more like work than it does fun a shame because it is pretty clever sold at lob for 15gbp an instant classic in the cooperative genre great gateway game to get people into cooperative games un must have tra i giochi collaborativi acquisisce maggiore profondit  con alcune espansioni added to my collection in december  first played in september  a good game overall and a great one to play when you dont want to be too competitive such an amazing package proven game play plus amazing components solid for what it does gets boring after a few plays i played this one last of the matt leacock coops but i can understand why it is regarded the way it is and i like it a lot too it can feel a little scripted after a while but i have only played vanilla and i have read the expansions remedy the scripted feeling fun game can see that a good player could run the game like solitaire 25 it can be a very unforgiving game but its easy to learn and plenty of fun high quality components too fun classic but probably wont get plays once pandemic legacy is complete especially with pl2 coming out this year a great solo game i love this new breed of cooperative gaming for me its the door through which i can get my wife to the table pandemic was fun and once wed had a few turns not too complicated ive only ever played with four players  but it seemed just right cassidy and i played this one tonight this is a really good game as you play you can see the timer counting down and the in game ai is really good you and your friends are playing against the game trying to cure diseases we lost this game is destined to become a classic very simple rules easy cooperative play and multiple skill levels make this game one you will come back to high quality parts and great graphics make it great addition to the collection dislikes the player tokens are huge not a real problem but they look a bit bigger than everything else on the board digital version on steam purchased  great game vanilla is good but adding in in the lab and the negative event cards from state of emergency takes this to great most played game of our collection excellent cooperative game  3 player game  we won with the last turn of the game  1 x 3 player and 1 x 2pl 2 roles each  lost twice but two player was close  3 player and beat it but it was close  3 pl  another very close game  won with 2 cards outstanding  5 pl  close but lose by poss 2 turns  4 pl  close again but lost  2 cured  4 pl  we won cured all 4 with 4 turns to go  4 pl  we won by 1 card yess  derek drew 4 epidemic cards on 5 of his turns sigh  5 pl  lost but only just had eradicated 2 and cured a third and on way to eradicate 4th but ran out of turns striking how close games can be excellent design slightly boring for me everything is basically spelled out for you obviously there are a lot of unknowns but its pretty easy to tell if youre going to win or lose and how you will get there when playing this game the expert in your gaming group with conflict with the other expert when telling you what to do for your turn this is an excellent cooperative game the different types of cards roles events player deck infection deck provide a lot of randomization it is something different every time i play it it forces players to be very flexible make a really good plan to take care of a problem  the next round of infection cards make you change the plan excellent simple coop game that requires some strategy to win the game will require all of the players to communicate and talk about what their next few turns will look like the game progresses very smoothly and it has a good feel to it harder than we thought it would be we loved forbidden island  thought this would be fun too the tow games are so similar but pandemic is much harder we win far less often i love than my 8 year really gets into solving  cooperating rather than competing plus its such a bonus that she now know where lima is cooperative game that weve yet to win once the viruses take hold they are difficult to reign back getting better with our team work but probably need to try other strategies the game is good but my game partner seems to be losing the will to play due to our inability to win one of the better cooperation games that tough to beat i like the challenge and the theme but i just dont care formay cooperative games target mt pleasant sc 10th anniversary edition supposedly doesnt have one of the route connections on the regular pandemic board havent checked mine dont care interesting mechanic for a game but difficult to find the right group of players without a strong alpha in my family everyone has an opinion and everyone wants to approach the situation their way i dont get to game that much but when i do i want to be able to select a strategy without having to settle for an inferior one or having to fight to defend a better one so i guess i fit right in it is also difficult to find just the right difficulty level  it seems that the game is either too easy to beat or impossible to beat with on the brink there arent enough games in the middle where different play would have made the difference between winning and losing after the game ends i never find myself saying if i only moved to rio rating for first few plays 75 rating for subsequent plays 6 once the uniqueness of cooperative play and having the recently used infection cards return to the top of the deck wore off for me but my family still enjoys it obviously a masterpiece design some friends have to play at least one session when they come overcool added later well yes and no its a masterpiece design that much was true but those friends now request other games when they come over pandemic might be slipping a little bit in my personal list of preferences partly just because its a coop i think its good with constantlychanging gaming partners but when you play with the same one or two or three people all the time i think i prefer the history that builds up in competitive games still brilliant game obviously physical and digital steam android our first cooperative game still love playing it and we lose more than we win have yet to find someone that doesnt enjoy this game great familycoop game i highly recommend adding the in the lab expansion but still plays great on its own im pretty new to the board game community but i am having a great time sitting down with family and friends this game is quick and easy to learn and has plenty of strategy excellent game fast accessible and tough to win in many cases update had to get rid of this for space no hard feelings on my part good game one of the best coop games there is but only gets better with the expansion love to play this with the soundtrack to mr robot although ive never seen the show 24 players played 8 times solo with only 1 win enjoy the game very much but i think the mechanic definitely gets a bit old after multiple plays had one 4 player game where we lost as well and felt that there just wasnt enough player cards to effectively do anything it seemed like if you made a mistake early in the game then you might as well stop because youll never be able to keep up with the unrelenting tide of cubes originally a 9 downgraded to an 8 though i do very much enjoy this game feb 14 still play with my wife on occasion still very much enjoy it though we are definitely much better at it using 6 epidemic cards made it more fun wonderful way to show friends that boardgames can be more than monopoly or risk looking forward to trying the expansions coops were a failed experiment for me for trade i like it but purely cooperative games are perhaps not my thing i would prefer to play with the bioterrorist in the expansion that should shake things up i guess i should mentiion how excellent the design is this is truly a solid game but as i said coop games are notr eally for me for others this might be pure gold i really like the simple yet fun mechanics the game is quick and the cooperative nature is enjoyable my first game with my wife felt like we were doing great until we noticed that the draw pile was almost depleted luckily we were able to cure the last disease just before it ran out we had fun with this game and will play it more we barely won on the introductory game so i cant imagine how bad it will get on the higher difficulty levels what a great game 24 players community 14 players best 4 players the best cooperative game ever  period a simple but very clever opponent thanks to the role cards pandemic is a game with a great replay a classic aside acquire or ticket to ride very good game that is easy to teach and learn this is a fantastic coop game with well balanced roles for each person to take and a good mechanism for adjusting difficulty i like how the game really balances out between playing with 2 to playing with 4 people as the number of special abilities and chance to cover the whole board increase but the means for getting 5 cards of a color in one persons hand get more difficult the game mostly has very good components but sometimes i do feel myself wanting a little bit more theme as i go around chasing little cubes off the board still this game is always a great time and almost every time i play it the game ends with a nailbiter finish as we rush to cure the 4th disease while all the other elements of the game threaten to defeat us that is exactly how any coop game should play out in the endgame every bit as good as its reputation suffers slightly from onedominantplayer syndrome i really enjoy playing this one the best coop game ive played the main problem is that there tends to be one person playing and everybody else following that persons lead in my experience my favorite coop game fantastic graphic design tense gameplay in under an hour quarterbacking can be an issue with some groups very fun game would recommend to it any one its very fun playing coop but some times it can turn into 1 person strategizing while every one else plays along i am not sure if this game will get much love from me since i have gotten the most recent instalment fall of rome but this game defiantly served its purpose and is one of my all time highest played games it will always hold a place in my heart i have not met one person that does not like this game this is my new gateway game for ngfs and geeks alike a coop that all 4 of you are trying to rid the earth of 4 deadly deseases i am changing my rating to a 10 as i think about it cannot wait for the expansion the board is too small and the pieces too big and you may sometimes lose before you get a chance to play these are the only major negative points on the plus side its a quick playing cooperative game with a theme that engages almost anyone who tries it hard to just play it once after its set up coop games arent meant to be beaten every time pandemics spirit is akin to tetris where you dont really expect to finish the game but rather see how long you can hold out until the world collapses around you you would need players that apply computational analysis to the characters and patterns of each play session in order to routinely defeat this board even then the challenge differs with each random assortment of characters and diseaseridden cities despite the rarity of completion this is a title that will manage to entice less orderlyminds to wade into the struggle for a plaguefree world again and again cooperativo en el que tendr s un rol con una habilidad especial especial tus misi n es conseguir la cura de las tedas las enfermedades y controlar que no se extienda la epidemia juego r pido entretenido y con una dificultad muy buena tiene un toque de azar que puede hacerte perder la partida y puede tener efecto l der si un jugador quiere llevar el mando dificultad 310 diversi n 710 rejugabilidad 610 me gusta entretenido con un nivel de dificultad muy bueno no me gusta efecto lider si tienes mala suerte es imposible ganar nice coop game with easy rules and plays fast very hard to win                         i like the idea but i think it can be a bit boring a great game but requires the expansion after a few plays great coop game hard to win but still fun trying great game could do with getting myself the expansion amazing cooperative game that leaves you wanting to play again mainly because you lost last game it provides a unique challenge integrating ideas to find the best possible solution to a hoard of overwhelming problems if you are playing this game right several small rules often go unnoticed its extremely difficult i have played 60 times and won only about 20 of those luck does play a small part in this game but most problems can be foreseen android si fuera mejor estoy seguro de que me gustar a m s la diversi n var a mucho de grupo a grupo y hay veces las cuales el juego perdona muy poco los errores super tense coop game love it the original and the best coop at its finest microbadge still my favorite board game of all time seems to easy and is frustrating that you dont have to eliminate the disease entirely good intro to coop game probably overplayed it now i suppose perhaps im just not a cooperative game player this really just leaves me rather bored and im not sure where the game is i can see the mechanics and i think there are some clever ones here but i dont see why this isnt just a solo puzzle as opposed to a game it just fails to engage me the game is good but i find it easily gets confusing and out of control that is the intention i am sure and i do like the game it is a cooperative game which is nice i just find it too difficult to win pandemic seems like a lot of other games but the main difference is the characters are doctor who are trying to fight off diseases which i like because it s not like all of the other games on the brink expansion the designer matt is my nephew a coop game where players are trying to save the world from 4 deadly viruses its a good and surprisingly simple game which almost anyone can pickup easily the mechanics are streamlined and the epidemic and outbreak system is well implemented unfortunately the simplicity of the game means that it lacks flavor there is no distinguishing factor for the diseases they all act the same way and have no names and because of that i dont see this game having much replayability in short a fun family game but one which will probably not really appeal to hardcore gamers have played 2x now on the easiest level hard game to win an enjoyable cooperative game often times tense played a few times and everyone learned it easily even those who didnt appreciate the theme aka germophobes lol not their favorite but everyone enjoyed it i did too i wouldnt place this up w7 wonders but i think it has potential its a little frustrating but i think adding some house rules makes it a little better look forward to finding more coop games this game shines if you have a group of players that knows how to play the game otherwise you are better of playing it solo i really love this game one of the best cooperation game simply rules i never really saw the appeal of pandemic but now that ive played it i get it this game is a lot of fun and a serious challenge our first game we literally won within a single turn of losing we were out of cards in the player deck and were able to finish as the last player finished his turn its a frantic coop scramble to save the world from disease and we all really enjoyed it reviewed on mounted cloud great game even if i dont like cooperative games this one glued me to itslef d i initially thught that its much more repetative but randomness in cards makes it much different each time you play the thing that i didnt like the most is the fact that you can loose to the game in 1st turn without any chance also too much randomness in card drawing is the reason why its 8 and not 9 quality of the cards is not really great because in our first 2 games 2 cards got damaged yes we were very careful with the game its not difficult yet its not unplayably easy you dont need any gaming experience to be able to catch this one up very fast another great thing is the length  usually ends up in  minutes so during the evening you can play several games dont have any expansion currently fun coop with a theme that people are drawn to components  artwork 35 game mechanics  rules 3 ease of learning 3 depth of theme 3 replayability 3 player uptime 3 total 31 i enjoy playing this game but have only beaten it once i think that might tint my view of it still a fun game to play though coop game of saving the world from deadly diseases fairness note our family does not prefer coop games however weve played with other several times outside our family as well and just cant get into it it is very difficult to beat the game and honestly did not find it enjoyable finally got around to selling the game at the beginning of the real pandemic in  for us good riddance but glad so many others enjoy it play more games 1st gamewell we decided to play the easy route and owner of game set it up and we ran through it we won im usually not happy about a coop game that can be beaten in the first play when you dont know the system well and probably are making some extra moves that dont need to be made well as it turns out we seeded the deck wrongand actually had an ultraeasy game on our hands as we played without 2 epidemic cards now for the game play i love it you feel a real sense of urgency in this game it feels so important to get so much done in such a little amount of time this can be a brutal game if wed have had even one of the extra epidemics in there i think wed have lost fun game very intense i do feel this is one of those expansions in mind games and wont be surprised if we see an expansion for it sooner rather than later update played it twice more both times this time we are on heroicim still at 66 win ratio difficult coop game but probably the best accessible coop game that exists has enough random elements to keep it fresh each time but isnt a pseudo guessing game like forbidden island everyone should try this game spielebox 2p cooperative theme mechanic i know this game is widely loved but im not a fan of coop games if theyre highly vulnerable to alpha player problems and this one does absolutely nothing to counter that for me its not so much about one player taking over a game its about all decisions being made by committee it feels like each player is playing every role to some extent when that happens as an alpha gamer i prefer everyone to make the most optimal moves but i prefer coops that include mechanics that preclude 1 one person dictating the entire gameflow and 2 games where most or all decisions are made by committee this is a solo game pretending to be multiplayer the game itself is great the only thing keeping me from rating it hgher is because its very easy to get frustrated when the game beats everyone repeatedly ive played it about twenty times and have only won twice interesting cooperative game im still undecided how easydifficult it is x nothing actually wrong with the game except one intelligent player could make all the limited decisions for 4 players without any problem i fail to see this as more than a solo game id rather catch a cold than play again incredible intro level boardgame if im playing with someone new to boardgames this is one of the first ones to hit the table so much love for this game in the community it seems and my girlfriend also really enjoys playing it a lot as much as i want to like this game it just felt a little bland and basic to me everytime we played it so far for me its lacking suspense and atmosphere maybe one of the many expansions will do it for me  time might tell i will only play this with the on the brink expansion one of the better coop games as usual one player pretty much runs the game after third play raised rating to 8 from 75 well designed game with simple mechanics which blend well with each other the theme looks pasted at first but it meshes well with the mechanics as a friend put it it looks very stupid in the beginning but when you get the idea it becomes very interesting gtc boo i dont like coops that much this is the worst of them i will almost never accept an invitation to play this game quite a disappointment easy boring nothing in for a ghost stories veteran love the components design idea and implementation wife hates it so gets little play 41 this cooperative game has become a big hit and has become the gateway game for my sister and her husband recently added the on the brink expansion it is a blast first time i played i walked away thinking winning was all based on luck too many car draws to get lucky or unlucky draws with after reading some tips i can see how some of this can be planned for but i still think that luck is going to have a big impact on if you win or lose i think the my main issue with the game is that you dont have have many options for actions most of the actions are just ways to move then theres building research stations healing people finding a cure and trading knowledge cure is not an option for an action if you can do it then you do theres no reason to put it off healing people isnt really a decision because theres usually a few cities at 3 that need to be taken care of so you move and then heal those areas that need it its mostly a forced action research stations waste cards so youre really only looking to do that if the role that build them is out of the game so the only real decision in the game is trading knowledge and imo thats such an action waster that i would argue that its best just to heal and draw cards and get the cures if someone gets lucky we had to waste 3 peoples turns to trade enough cards for a cure and that was with efficient planning one of them was usually the medic so we were losing out on taking a lot of cubes off the board to get the cures in the meantime we added 6 cubes to the board putting us closer to outbreaks which is how we lost in the end im wondering how many times people have won this have been either lucky card draws at the beginning of the game or people missing rules that restrict the researcher or sharing knowledge in general cooperative starters gamenot so much replayability though i m not fond of cooperative games pandemic is an example of a gateway game a game that allows new gamers to see what the hobby can be in pandemic players work together to eradicate 4 separate diseases from the world its very tense at times and it is always interesting as with any cooperative game there is the possibility for one player to become the de facto leader railroading the decision making of other players the best way to avoid this problem is through playing with a group that has the same level of experience we played this at ucon  i am sure people have complaints about pandemic such as quaterbacking and damage control which honestly you get tired of both after playing a few coop board games these days this is my take pandemic is a more interesting version of forbidden island with a risklike element to it  i love forbidden island and so also loved pandemic it was hard to tell before playing it if i would like it or not some reviews made me wary and others made me curious i think now that none of those people had played forbidden island or else they would have been forced to mention it pandemic is forbidden island stolen reimagined slightly and rethemed and made bigger and a bit more boardgamey and relevant that is a global virus spreading is more topical and relevant to us than a magical island sinking which we can stop how and we care because yea i think you get the point so just like forbidden island damage control flood management handsize management character placement management set collection and timed tracks also the really cool overflow mechanic which can set off chain reactions which ended the world in our game i liked the flightbycards and controlcenterbuilding mechanics too there is even an option for one player to be a bad guy bio terrorist and a 5th virus expansion i liked pandemic oddly enough it is now at the top of my toget coop game list cant wait till we can afford to buy it oi p coop gateway game love it about the only game you can get rocked after coasting the entire game on the last turn and call it fun i wouldnt recommend playing it a lot in a short period of time though 414 humans really cool game very nifty coop game ive only played with 2 and it has seemed a little too easy im looking forward to playing more quite the hit update seems to have gotten played out among my friends needs an expansion i still recommend everybody try it a half dozen times update expansion roles revitalized this if i actually buy the expansion we can try the other cool stuff  a nice short cooperative game i really hope to introduce this to some casual players whom i would never expect to play shadows over camelot 3rd kids really enjoy this one i do too i think there are better coops out there with better art and more panicinducing mechanics but it was a good first exposure to coops the refreshing deck has been used in many other games i think due to pandemic so good job pandemic first cooperative game i ever played really like the theme the artworks of the new  reprint from zman games are awesome very nice and fun game should be in every gamer collection fun 7 quality 6 limited influence 1 various options 1 my first coop and one of my favorite games tense but fun with a great theme need to try on the brink via matthew my wife looooooves this game i really enjoy it i have only tried the expansions using windemic but the extra roles and new mechanics certainly push this up a few notches i really like this game ive gotten several people to play with no complaints unfortunately after playing several times it is much easier to beat and i am not finding enough challenge in it even the expansion doesnt seem to make it too difficult you do lose occasionally if the game play works out to put you in a losing situation i have played with more players than the game was made for in the base set and it doesnt hurt the games mechanics to put 5 players in a 4 player game here i love this game the cooperative aspect is great and it is a great victory when you actually win i find i end up replaying this game an awful lot i need to play some more before i get why it is so popular not my type of game the cards play you rather than a game where you drive the sequence of play very rewarding play if i can resist the urge to treat new players as minions i like this one cooperative game in which the goal is to cure 4 diseases before they outbreak too many times or time runs out you run out of cards to draw pandemic is extremely tightly designed and very well streamlined as well as being one of the most intense experiences in board gaming without good player communication and team work there is very little chance of beating the game tons of replay value the pinnacle of cooperative gaming pw love it but gets stale fast ive heard it said that pandemic is the embodiment of the alpha player problem i reject that utterly the alpha player is the problem not the game if you are willing to stand up for yourself and tell the alpha that they are running the game for others then it will stop if they are a reasonable human being if they dont stop then why in the world would you play games with that person ive also heard it said that pandemic can be played solo as though there were some problem with games that have 1 player variants can you play it alone yes is it more fun playing it with others yes what is the problem the length of the game is great the theme is awesome the game mechanics are fantastic it is a truly cooperative experience the replayability is good the learning curve is incredibly small this game is incredible sure its a gateway game but its still challenging even for experienced gamers im not a huge fan because this one is prone to quarterbacking as am i and theres no secret information here to help with preventing it like other games do replayed and increased number from 5 to 7 clever mechanics fun gameplay flexible audience good to play with people who dont often play board games or at the other end of the spectrum with one other experienced player a really fun perfectly themed game my friend and i love cooperative games and this one is a lot simpler than others that we play lots of replayability due to roles cant wait to get the expansion imo not the supergame it is often hyped to be but its clever and different and fun good coop game good starter coop game set up is quick gameplay is smooth i realy love this game ive played it a few times already and it certainly lives up to the hype i can see that the second edition components are a huge improvement too as are the nice component improvements you get with the expansions great game i honestly have no idea why this game is so highly ranked i actually dont think that theres anything much wrong with it but i dont see anything good about it either if you do want a relatively light cooperative game i will admit that im not a big fan of coops in the first place  i play games to beat people even if i rarely manage it  i think forbidden island which is almost the same game with a different theme both has better more streamlined gameplay and better components to boot but my wife loves this and has played it hundreds of times with her best friend what they see in the game is also a mystery to me the coop style is fun when you are looking for something a little different this game can get very tense my wife and i love this game love playing this game very collaborative can be tough to learn all the roles and figure out the game at first but once you get the swing of it can be really fun with lots of opportunity for replay amazing coop game easy to pick up with lots of strategy quite enjoy this one this is a game that i love a lot and have played so many times that i sort of got sick of it and havent played it in a long time if thats not a compliment i dont know what is great gateway game one reason ive played it so many times and a great theme original printing probably the most popular cooperative game out there and the game that really kicked the cooperative game into high gear i think i need to give this another chance since i really enjoyed the legacy implementation of it it is a great gateway game as well because of its appealing theme and has become a modern classic i am part of the hype around this game and thoroughly enjoy it the theme makes sense and there is a great amount of tension in this game it feels like a race against time trying to figure out the best course of actions to be able to stop the spread of the diseases based on one game only  pretty fun and different to be cooperative rather than batling it out keen to play again not into cooperative games i guess cool coop game i just barely beat it in hard mode not going to try legendary coz i know i need a lot of luck for that suffers from quarterbacking but since im the owner i tend to not let one ppl do the thinking its a great brainstorming game also loved to teach this to kids so they can learn to do teamwork maybe can get a bit repetitive after 10 games traded it coz my game groups doesnt really dig coop games i like the cooperative element raised it based on additional games really helps cross into nongamer appeal dropped it again it does what it does very well and is very easy to get people to play i just ntoiced that i dont have that postgame excitement when playing it any more dropped it again frustrating because i really like the mechanics just am not into the group puzzle solving conindrums i always enjoy this one great for nongamers 24 jugadores easy enough to play has decent replayability best when you let everyone contribute and limit anyone controlling the coop effort which means all those playing have to participate for best experience great game have on the brink on the way got lucky finding a copy this is a very fun challenging coop my wife has really taken a liking to this game so weve been playing it pretty often our success rate is a bit low maybe 35 on normal level a lot of it has to do with the luck of the draw i normally play with the ops expert and special events from the expansion great to play with adults great coop game evil mechanics unveil during the first turn this is a game you dont just play once each time a really involved game experience  great gateway game bonus points great fun even with just 2 simple to learn enjoyed by nongamers always gets a lets do that again response my fiance and i play this together online for while he is long distance to work on our cooperation and communication skills heh only problem with this game is you can only play with people as familiarunfamiliar as the game as you are otherwise a lot of bossing around happens also while there is some general strategy involved this is more of a logistics planning game works great but not as satisfying to me as an economic game cooperative game of stopping an outbreak before the world all gets infected tough and fun  wietna gra kooperacyjna gra si  dobrze i nie jest zbyt  atwo wygra  mo e na razie bo dla mnie ta gra to nowo   amazing a modern classic if you havent played it youre not a true gamer a genredefining coop i really like this game but it does suffer from the alphaplayer syndrome some roles are better than others what a great coop this is the coop of choice so simple can be quite intense one can always ramp up the difficulty or incorporate modules from the excellent expansion works really well and quite satisfying whether we win and save the world or we die from some nasty plague not owned as everyone else seems to have a copy 20 all but once played w on the brink our first cooperation game we liked it after first play will be a frequent guest on the table i think it plays differently depending on the roles chosen sometimes its too easy sometimes very challenging the game that popularized coops extremely accessible and engaging with a serious theme that appeals to many nongamers yes if player skill differs widely pandemic can suffer from the director issue but i dont see that as a fundamental flaw almost all strategy games suffer when played with players of widely differing skill levels singling out this issue in coop games while not acknowledging it in competitive games is disingenuous truth in advertising i playtested pandemic added 2 roles and rewrote its rules for 2nd edition and coauthored its expansions very challenging coop game easy to learn but difficulty ramps up quickly best with probably 3 or 4 players only problem is players have to work together so much it forces everyone to be on the same level otherwise one or two people take over and basically run everyones turn not bad but really not into coop games probably my favorite coop of its type but the game doesnt vary much from playtoplay not really a 5 player cooperative game so much as a 1 player game where everyone makes decisions by committee the mechanics are sound and the tension is good but it really needs some kind of rules for limited information sharing between players like battlestar galactica i think the expansion with the bio terrorist could really improve the game smooth playing coop game is best with 4 people may get repetetive over time my first cooperative game in my collection great game i think part of what makes this game work so well are the player roles each role has a different special ability this helps give everyone a stake in what is going on and a real role to play since no one else on the team can duplicate the role a great addition to my collection juego cooperativo que te permite interactuar y manipular a tus compa eros para llegar a un bien com n la muerte de toda la raza humana debido a virus terribles gran juego lo disfruto mucho for a game ive played a billion times i am pretty meh about it its a fine diversion and other gamers and nongamers seem to love the game but for me its just something i do and remain fairly unengaged with and its another alpha dog put out the fire coop i have trouble with these as unless i keep very strict control of myself i can start to act like the alpha dog at this point ill be honest this is a great game i am utterly tired of which is why it is rated as low as it is a near perfect game in my opinion especially with on the brink expansion have not yet found another cooperative game that rivals it if you like the idea of a coop game and dont mind the theme its the place to start my review httpwwwboardgamegeekcomarticle lp 29apr17 the first modern board game we ever played and for that i will always love it pretty much always happy to play  classic  coop game doesn t come out much after a dozen ore more plays maybe it will with newer gamers still a good game completely immersive coop love it eddig a t k letes t rsasj t k  lm ny sz momra my favorite coop game i enjoy the modern theme i also enjoy the purity of the design the designer simply lays bare the cooperative element and allows the players to interact together against random card pulls my only complaint as with all coops is that a dominant personality can steamroll play in a way that makes me wish i was simply playing the game solitaire best coop game i ever played smooth mechanic and lots of decisions waiting for refreshed version a must have if youre in to coop games this game is phenomenal and its so fun to play with new people it is hard to decide how much to steer the new player when youre all in it together but its always loads of fun many many games looks hard to beat and tough to treat with rest of players revision very interactive game which my girl never wishes ending to play my first taste of cooperative gaming and an encouraging one at that the idea of uniting against the game seemed odd but is carried through here with aplomb this game is difficult to beat and the tension becomes intense towards the end victories normally attained in the very last turn if i ever beat this on the hard level i will know that i have earned my gaming spurs  theme  easy to learn  epidemic rng is frustrating  very puzzley which can lead to quarterbacking a favorite to introduce to those new to modern board gaming who prefer cooperative games the variety offered by dealing out different role cards is largely superficial and games blend together quite quickly after a dozen plays if new players arent turned off by the dutchtheme i much prefer pandemic rising tide best with 4 great with all other counts pandemic 13 4 45 min 10 242 br  one of the best coop games out there only drawback is experienced players will tend to take over the game in essence playing for the whole team sleeves ok regras pt ok always get it on the table with none gamer friends my wife is not into board games but i convinced her to watch whil wheatons tabletop edition of pandemic and she was immediately intrigued now the two of us team up and cure the world from diseases at least once or twice a week its easy to play and understand and you can win as easily as you can lose we are definitely going to pick up the expansion to help add a little more chaos into the tactics we are already mastering i definitely recommend this game for any kind of player especially if you want a peaceful evening thanks to the cooperativeonly mechanics no competitive hostility necessary just an unforgiving game enjoyment value 45 replay value 45 difficulty 35 moderate components quality 45 good an easytolearn challengingtowin coop game the theme of the game makes it super interesting and it certainly gets you on the edge of your seat the game is different every time you play thanks to the random generation of starting cities where each of the diseases begin with six different roles its fun to play each one and get a feel for different perks which also bumps up the replay value the game requires heavy concentration and cooperation  it just doesnt work when one person wants to take control everyone has to work together in order to win best played with themefitting music in order to make the best atmosphere i like this much better than say arkham horror theres a lot more tension and the way the roles interact is neat best of all when i go to a city to do something it happens in games like ah i roll a die to see if it happens i get much more enjoyment out of this kind of randomness and the backontopofthedeck mechanic controls that randomness makes it more purposeful very elegant game that im digging so far very nice game totaly different from the other games i play which makes it nice to have and play pandemic is a modern classic its almost always fun to play and a game with such smart design choices and universal appeal that ive almost picked it up multiple times despite my interest in the theme being rather low played with 2 and 3 players won both times i like it ive only played it with in the brink expansions i want to try in the lab im ready for the game to kick my butt  really tough to winbut still fun best coop game that ive played bgg ss  laminated rules on skydrive a simplistic eldritch horror  which is not such a bad thing given that it takes only half or a third as long to play every turn is a terrific logic problem bij ruben en feline excellent coop game easy to understand concept and roles tactics take time to develop  adding satisfaction growing with each game play well designed and tough to beat not usually in the mood for playing it but its a good game never played cooperative game with strategy and fun delicate balance between fighting curing and eradicating disease time is always a factor  as is cooperation were not really fans of coop games i only really enjoy them if theres a forcing function that makes it materially different than a single player game ex traitor in bsg hidden info in hanabi time constraints in space alert it seems good for what it is just not our cup of tea good solo game m this game made me not like coops the ap prone and the table captains come together to make things utterly unenjoyable but more than that i didnt care for the theme or the execution everyone seems to love this game but it wasnt for me at all great cooperative game good coop game that my family and friends enjoy always fun game probably best if played without expansion players 15 coop faltan 3 cartas need proxy way too difficult to be enjoyable i will never play again unless some house rules are implemented where you can trade a black card for instance with a player as long as youre in the same black city andor the hand limit is increased for all players pandemic has a great theme mechanics are superb the challenge is real the artwork is well ok thus it makes pandemic a very good classic but if you are a person who thinks multiple steps ahead of others especially if there is a new player in game  you only have half fun as well as your coops this works well only if you all are inexperienced equally experienced or equally alfa players also think it can get quite samey after a while first two games quite interesting so far im hoping for something the wife and i can enjoy together and so far im not convinced shes a big fan time will tell we love forbidden island so picked up a copy when amazon price dropped to  25 at launch for zman  edition only a couple of plays and it is tough with rules that take a while to sink in no issues with board printing but component quality not great for the price zatu 27  fun game great for introducing people to more than monopoly suffers from quarterbacking a little my group moved on from it since playing pandemic legacy s1 played it once looks interesting i find this really boring tbh as with most cooperative games after you get the strategy down its too easy with peter pandemic never really grabbed us like it does others but great game to introduce friends to euros basically a mediocre sologame that you play together okay i guess i just dont like coops epic this game is the best my wife and i got so into the game we even built our own little custom characters and pieces its great because you can just keep expanding on the game and make it more enriching we have overplayed this game recently i will shoot the next virus i see the more i play this the more it goes up playing pandemic legacy has brought my liking of the base game even higher great theme great coop great solo game too everyone seems to love this one our first cooperative game love this game and has opened up our eyes to a whole slew of games very fun working together works good with experienced players i just love the mechanics of this game everything makes sense and is relatable to how a pandemic could realistically spread this game got me into cooperative games something i never would thought to even try out and it is a simple game to learn but still different enough to enjoy each time really fun coop game great that players that have played it befor can easily learn new players the game the great culling thats a really hard cooperative game where you struggle to save the humanity from various deseases andrew i enjoyed the games ive played though havent had it out for a while this game puzzles me there is a good bit of tension here and i like the coop feeling but something about it just doesnt grab me i had high hopes for this still its fast paced with very decent mechanics one im likely to pull out for a gaming session with nongamers very cool cooperative game it can even be played as a solo game with 2 3 or 4 different roles since everything is known to all players a well designed easy to learn and nail biting game teaches a lot about cooperation planning and opportunity cost my only problem is with the accessibility of colors for the game pieces a few colors for characters are too similar which makes it difficult for color blind players to distinguish cooperative games ftw feels good healing the world  the game mechanics are really tight you almost feel that the fate of world is in your hands i liked the feel of this game while just playing it once at the easiest level i can understand how this can get out of control learning the rules was quite easy instruction book was great the quality of the board is good as are all the pieces the concept of cooperative play is great we played the first game a little wrong but caught ourselves after the fact we did not remove all cubes of one color for 1 action  a city after the cure was found we lost that game but played the second game correctly and ended up curing everything teamwork shines through in this game highly recommended pandemic is one of my favorite games i really enjoy the teamwork that comes out of the unique character abilities that each player has the game is somewhat like a puzzle but not one that is easily solvable there are many paths a team could take and its up to the group to decide how best to deal with each situation that comes up in that way the theme works very well its masterful design that really got me going in board gaming and has helped me introduce the hobby to many others coop tight playsurprisingly difficult weve had several plays of this  its still an enjoyable game classic coop game nice theme and great infection mechanic various levels of difficulty with the hardest one being next to impossible playable solo although not recommended a group of friends can readily enjoy it since its not too deep there is no reason to alpha other players and can be played if the group wants a coop game but with quick rules explanation and short gameplay can be played even 3 times in a row if the previous tries result in a quick outbreak game over exciting game but may be dominated by one player first impression  varied roles chain reactions epidemics and cooperation really make this game enjoyable i adore the mechanics for epidemics my first coop i got fun suspenseful tough mostly play with just my wife but when we get 4 people playing weve never won good game hard to win but all the sweeter when you do a great game and easy to introduce to new gamers creates a good amount of suspense as the infections get out of control this is a great cooperative game very much a fan of however this game is hard to bring out for most competitive people still highly suggest this one truly a fun romp im a fan of cooperative games would be an 8 except for the mistake of using yellow text when yellow is one of the disease colors was anyone paying attention at all there is no excuse for this the game is very random as well and i never use the word very the game is ultimately very easy and now relies on using the harder difficulty level to make it a challenge x played once i was sick and thankful for the alpha gamer that took the decisions it works its a basic youknowoneyouknowall coop not too pretty modern classic ill give it that but im not really interested in playing it my gateway game solid game and would recommend to anyone just getting into the board game hobby or if you have never played it before brutally hard to a fault the huge randomness makes it a bit disheartening sometimes but i guess it keeps me coming back update the randomness is less random that i thought at first the fact that the cards get recycled is the key part of the strategy the expansions take it from a simple game to something more complex and deeper and add lots of replayability my favorite coop zero for two in first two plays a four and a two player game for them very frustating you wont win very often and ppl you play wth can get restless or excluded cool concept and playing but its too hard and ppl want to relax not an instant classic my first experience with it was playing with strangers at essen spiel one of them was really badly quarterbacking all of us didnt look at it after that for several years to come when i finally agreed to play again with a group i knew well this was the beginning of a long and deep love for coop games neat game but there is a high probability of it being a solo game with other players acting as cube pushers app version play with medical friends very fun big team effort and teamplay easy to learnteach and to play pandemic is a tense heady cooperative game but also light in its presentation you do four things draw cards then infect the world the game is aesthetically well presented and plays smoothly its a great cooperative game and even pretty good solo shoutout to f2z for the ios implementation which also is very high quality i liked pandemic more when i was first getting into board games i would generally rather play something else nowadays meh serious problems with quarterbacking which frank houseruled out that one time played a game with the standard rules and holy shit that is absolutely no fun since you have one person telling you what to do more difficult than flash point id play it if someone else wanted to but i wouldnt really buy it though i somewhat enjoy pandemic because the cooperative gameplay encourages you to talk with the other players however i m not a fan of how this game can developer into an slow optimization exercise where players are thoroughly discussing every single move too cooperative for my tastes it feels like everyone controls every game character so there are no individual decisions why even give each person a character game we like to play but took a back seat after we played pandemic legacy s1 and other games took over looking to get this to the table more though the card reshuffling system is a work of genius and turns what would normally be a random deck of cards into a random but very predictable set of cards also with the idea of hot spots it thematically works almost too well i never thought that i would enjoy a pure coop game but pandemic pulled me in as long as you let everyone play their game this is fun i have realized that winning is quite random but the feel of control is good enough to make it enjoyable easy to teach included thingthing excellent game exciting a little luck based but still tense and fast paced an utterly gripping struggle for the fate of the human race players struggle to optimize their reactions to new cases of infection and outbreaks whenever the game proceeds without any horrid events for a while a mixture of hope and impeding doom slowly builds up only to give way to utter desperation the moment that yet another outbreak occurs even though both the theme and the mechanisms are somewhat abstract they work perfectly with one another certainly the best abstract cooperative game forbidden island by the same author employs almost all of the mechanisms of this game and it does not come across nearly as intense as this game the quintessential cooperative game and one of the few i actually like far surpassed by its legacy offspring love this game excellent coop where the group really has to coordinate in they want to beat the viruses german edition rules in english some text on cards but manageable if you have some german skills im not rating expansions so this rating for pandemic includes the legacy editions i really didnt get why this game is ranked so highly i did not enjoy it it felt more like solving a puzzle than playing a board game i hate this game dont know why i dont understand the buzz feels like theres too much random in the game and basically its a solo game 1 2 3 4 5 un jeu simple dintroduction aux jeux coop ratifs

28 coop is great on occasion interesting mechanics great coop mother of modern board game wwwwlwwwwl pandemic is my favourite game so far and probably the one ive played most its already a great game but works even better with the first expansion the closest thing to a perfect board game some amazing expansions are available as well this game is probably the most wellknown coop game of all time it has a good theme simple gameplay and short duration i put off trying this game for the longest time since i didnt think curing diseases was super interesting but it turns out this game is a huge cooperative puzzle that keeps fighting back every turn its a good design but it might be slightly overrated my favorite cooperative game it is rather quick and the mechanisms really work for the theme excellent coop game challenging and pure fun 63 62 the more i play this game the more i like it people who argue that the game is boring must be doing something wrong because to me it seems full of tenseness and anticipation  will the next draw contain an epidemic  aaargh another outbreak every game we play we either win or lose by just a hair extremely nailbiting definitely contains the bang for the buck on loan to andyc no comments rating based on first 4 plays with two other total newbies we lost all 4 cant wait to try it again edit after 21 playsrating sticks includes plays of pandemic legacy pandemic iberia and pandemic reign of cthulhu great coop game badded promos andor expansionsb  on the brink expansion  promo roles promo exp i have rarely come across a game that i wanted to buy after only one play this is the exception to that rule pandemic is that rare game where the players play as a team against the actual game it is also that rare game that is fun to play with 2 3 or 4 players  and can be equally challenging frustrating fun and devilishly clever all at the same time good for nongamers works best when eveyone knows the game always a good time marcin played this quite a few times now and really enjoy it easy level seems ok now and have ramped it up to 5 epedemic cards and its a bit tougher expansion on the brink belonged to jk gift from savages at apartment we had a lot of fun playing pandemic  boring after a while never found a coop with enough replayability played  times since  rediscovered this in  as a solo game and as a 2player with our son we played it once or twice when he was 10 and now he s 14 lots of variability with or without expansions a classic but a bit boring on its own after having played a bunch of the legacy versions pandemic legacy season 1 being by far the best type family strategy mechanic action point allowance system cooperative play hand management point to point movement set collection variable player powers players 2  6 lots of fun cooperative game plays differently than a lot of games some of the roles are much more powerful than others so some games might be more of a challenge than others great bang for your buck more challenging the more players you have have won 2 out of 3 games with 4 epidemic cards and 0 out of 2 with 5 epidemic cards once within 10 minutes 3 plays classic nothing i can say that hasnt been said i enjoy it this game is like group work in high school the experiencedlearnedambitious person does all the work and everyone else sits around and goes along with it it doesnt feel like youre playing a game at that point when someone else makes a majority of the decisions maybe i just have an issue with coop games one of the best coop  cooperative game that is fantastic to play one of the cleverest ideas i have met in my boardgaming life intense icky quick and fun my intro into cooperative games and what an intro it was the gameplay is tight and still challenging after repeated plays this is the game i would choose to introduce new gamers to the world of cooperative play feels a bit like a lighter version of eldritch horror but i like the theme and the fast gameplay first run we played no more than ten minutes before we lost the game but the second run whent better the game is pretty good and i enjoy trying to save the world and being defeated quite often however and although it seemed like a positive aspect the fact that its a cooperative game can lead to a very uncomfortable experience ive played it less than 10 times and thats been enough to see how some players can feel like they are not playing at all i mean when its their turn they usually do what someone else tells them to do either because its their first time playing or because there is an alpha gamer short brutal elegant spare this game is a lot of fun the girlfriend likes it because its coop i think we have more fun losing than winning this is a simple and fun coop game but it can easily degenerate into one person telling everyone else what to do if youre not careful whether this game is fun or not depends more on who youre playing with than most games interesting game but the theme is a bit blah and abstracted its hard to get excited to play this game even though i have respect for its design update on the brink is a fantastic expansion adds the variety and challenge a game like this needs and component storage imo its a must buy if you own pandemic it is that essential cooperative game lite but with enough meat on it to continually get played nothing to complain about here 45 min 2 plays so far but both were very fun with each of us chipping in ideas on what we should do and weighing pros and cons my tip for players to lower the chances of alpha players is to make it a house rule to let the turn player give his ideas first before the rest can give in theirs coop  solo fofa candidat great one must be played with the expansion though my second coop game my son likes it a lot but for me something seems to be missing ive only played it with more than 2 players once so that may be colouring my experience first coop game really enjoy the medical theme still prefer this over flash point eventually needed the expansion to keep things fresh likely some unrecorded plays your team of experts must prevent the world from succumbing to a viral pandemic accepted may 30  24 player  11  8  7 artificially inflated score 9 meeplesource components what a great game tight rules wonderful gameplay i taught my game group this game and watched from another table as they were deeply engaged matt leacock is a terrific designer and i really enjoy playing all his stuff family favorite great team game played multiple times with different playersexpansionsroles consistently enjoyable with a reasonable level of difficulty the entropy in the setup really helps with this game amazing game simple and fun every time sold this game can quickly devolve into a single player game theres usually only one right move to be made and its usually pretty obvious what that move is the first coop game i played that really worked played the legacy games and played with non games players people who arent competitive like the coop nature m updated rating 65 initial rating 75 update not a fan of the interplayer dynamic that develops during the game it lessens the games enjoyability for me after a few plays the game begins to feel the same initial thoughts plays smoothly fun puzzle that is constantly shifting the best course of action each turn is somewhat obvious so it feels a little scripted at times and can be susceptible to quarterbacking by dominant players since its generally the same type of actions every game im not sure the replayability interested in expansions simply the best game ever made love the expansions too  really nice coop game only problem is the fact that the game is a bit puzzle like the dominant player can easily ruin the game for others base game mediumheavy 14 players 45 min  cooperative disease game great cooperative game would recommend to anyone it can get a bit one sided if there is an experienced player in the group  easily resolved if they consciously hold back on guiding less experienced players good replay value too with varying difficulty levels characters could be balanced a bit more  we havent won the game yet without the medic definitely worth buying i like forbidden island better  i just dont like this game cant put my finger on why but hate that a great plan gets messed up because of luck update i loved it before the expansion now im confident in calling it my favorite coop game update i am still really enjoying this one after a few more plays  the rules are very clear for a coop game a genre that has a lot of games with terrible rulebooks and i really enjoy how the theme works with the game mechanics this has the potential to be my favorite coop game a genre that i really enjoy i have really enjoyed ghost stories as well as the classic in the genre lord of the rings first impressions are highly favorable and i am looking forward to more plays wife and i enjoy playing played many times and still enjoy i like this game a lot this is probably the ultimate coop game a few of my friends dont like this game for that very reason there is no individual winner you all lose or win as a team thats it the components are basic but gets the job done its meant to be a little abstract and i can appreciate that especially considering the subject matter sadly not quite the kind of cooperative game i was looking for favorite and only cooperative game hooked 2 to 4 players science  medical action point allowance system  cooperative play  hand management  point to point movement  set collection  trading  variable player powers enjoyed this a lot though on the table less frequently once we won at highest difficulty level once led to late nights as failure prompted must save the world at least once before finishing muy bueno sencillo f cil de jugar con un setup c modo dificultad variable y siempre un reto httpscestadepatoswordpresscomcuandoestardeparaprevenir imho this is one of those coop games where one overbearing person simply plays by themselves by forcing everyone else to do what they want i love coop games when done right like robinson crusoe but pandemic has become tiresome to me because it seems like someone always plays the game by themselves good but can easily be alphagamed rated after 17 plays mostly solo cooperative game the difficulty level can be urlhttpboardgamegeekcomthreadfinetuningthedifficultylevelsadjusted and customizedurl good with any number of players including colorredsolitairecolor the difficulty increase with more players i like this game except reshuffling cards ultrapro sleeved purchased  pandemic is a winner for me because of the cooperative nature of the game and the theme its definitely more of an adults game it does suffer a bit after numerous plays as you start to figure out its puzzle and can recognize better what is an optimal strategy but its still possible for the game to occasionally just give you a good kicking though usually this is down to bad luck in the card draws a solid coop that rightly deserves its high status update traded away as thunderbirds now scratches a similar itch and i think its thematically richer classic pandemic in a pretty box its a fun and well made game with some interesting but frustrating mechanics the game loses its thrill after a couple of play through once it lost its spark i recommend buying the pandemic legacy season 1 to truly experience what the pandemic concept is capable of played solo and it works fine just the right level of challenge without being too fiddly very smooth mechanics and ruleset clear game moves along quickly and you have to coordinate the moves of the different roles to win engrossing relaxing rather than overly taxing a negative point is that some roles are much better than others with the scientist medic researcher and operations expert you have a better chance of winning dispatcher and contingency planner are underpowered in comparison but this means that you can adjust difficulty through role selection there is a deterministic aspect to the game depending on which infection cards come out first but its still fun some tension but not too much and not frustrating or boring on the other hand i would say it is just a tad too complex for many families solo 24 players somewhat disappointing probably because of my high expectations still pretty good per i quanto i materiali e le componenti fossero fatte bene questo gioco lho finito per odiare per vari motivi uno di questi sicuramente il fatto che la scatola non ha un organizer e per preparare una partita ci stavi un sacco dato il gran numero di compontenti la difficolt  eccessiva del gioco completamente cooperativo alcuni poteri di alcuni personaggi erano inutili altri troppo forti quindi dovevi avere fortuna in pi  si gioca fondamentalmente contro il mazzo che essendo un oggetto inanimato con contrattacca alle tue mosse noiso dopo la prima partita a really interesting game very unique i found i like the cooperative aspect of it and others have commented on how it encourages conversation the big downside i found is that whomever is the dominant player generally controls the game as newbies have no idea what to do and just blindly listen to who does since im often the dominant player i like it as i can strategize lots of fun yay lets save the world cool game i used it to learn to play the legacy version and enjoyed it playing with more epidemics in the deck makes it sooooo more difficult almost impossible to win with 6challenging had fun playing solo with friends and tried a couple expansions too very enjoyable coop game mein exemplar verschenkt andreas u carsten kooperativ rank overall 89 strategy 104 family 10 76 your team of experts must prevent the world from succumbing to a viral pandemic 2 4 players community 1 4   best 4 45 min age 10 a favourite in one of my gaming groups always a great challenge playing on heroic difficulty hasta el momento buen juego cooperativo con mucho mas que hacer de lo que parece inicialmente cooperative game its interesting but the best player can play on his own as well  for me pandemic is lacking as a cooperative game it seems to run best when one or two people are heavily quarterbacking and just isnt that much fun for the other players also not a fan of how unaccomplished i feel whenever we win im not sure why but it always feels like my actions had no real bearing on the outcome i like the variable player powers the dynamic puzzle the game offers and the quality of components well done matt mexico intense game probably the best coop game out there the theme is unique and the mechanics make a lot of sense highly recommend the new version thats out this game is very good but its overrated not sure its even in my top 5 coop games and if it is its probably because i need to play more of them its a solid game to get but its pretty middleoftheroad within a good game collection in my opinion the main fault of this game is the common fault of coop games that the personpeople who know how to play best can basically tell everyone what to do great introduction to coops difficulty is scalable which improves ability to play over and over again game can annoying depending on personalities so if there is an alpha in the group you may want to set some ground rules about how decisions are made likewise if there is a person who doesnt think strategically you may find yourself holding their hand the hold time story line is fun and gameplay is simple despite the initial complexity of setup and rules cooperative game based on eradicating disease the epidemic mechanic is excellently designed and can definitely send the board spiraling out of control must be careful to not let one player take over all of the decision making want to try on the brink once i get a couple more plays in great coop game easy to teach and to pick up for everyone n o consigo ganhar nem com apenas quatro cartas de epidemia parece ser imposs vel ganhar esse jogo mas adoro jogo sempre com rigor m ximo nas regras creio que isso   indispens vel em um cooperativo possui bastante min cias de regra se voc  ganhou f cil uma partida de pandemic releia o manual pois provavelmente errou alguma regra importante good coop tough to not succumb to the leader issue games like this have i try to use house rules to prevent people from sharing whats in their hands very smooth and exciting game easy to adjust difficult level to match your skill downside is that better more experienced players easily can dictate how to play so it becomes their game and others just follow their instructions instead of making their own decisions this game is interesting at the start but the more you play it the more boring it gets a bit overrated but good cooperative game my kids and i have now played this game 20 times it moves quick is easy to play and lots of fun acceptable game does not worth the rush but overall it is a good experience might be bored of it after several plays as it becomes repetitive always greatness gateway coop game  the best coop game ive played it also plays very well as a solitary game i thought this wasnt that good but it is requires a lot of teamwork you have to choose carefully your characters so you can combine your skills towards your goals the most frustratingamazing game at the same time dont get down on yourself if you are new to this game just keep playing and you will start to figure it out even when you get really good at this game you will still only win 60 percent of the time                                                                         awesome game dynamic of reshuffling to intensify the outbreak bought it for ipad havent won yet though  have now easier with two players very interesting and replayable cooperative game works well with nongamers forward planning essential great game but replay value is limited play with the extension to go from 8 to 10 a great gateway coop thats become stale for me vanilla has gotten old and pandemic the cure def fires the base game however i will only play with the expansions esp in the lab those give it a lot of life variability and challenge to keep the game fresh ok ive got 8 plays under my belt so i feel it is safe to comment on this game i would say the best way to describe this is that the winloss seems to be like solitaire  you dont necessarily know if you are going to win when you begin but it certainly feels like it is preordained before you even begin its through playing the game that you even know if you stand a chance further the game really seems to lend itself to players that are power control freaks rather than each player trying their best it seems that one person needs to dictate specific strategies to get anywhere  and the likelihood of you winning can be nil if the bad luck of the draw screws you over not fun weve won 1 game out of 8 if you like to lose and move your pieces at someone elses behest then this game is for you otherwise i recommend moving along update wahooo i traded this game off to someone thank goodness for bgg  im now the lucky owner of a mah jong set classic coop gets even better with the in the lab expansion great intro coop game pandemic the cure replaced this game for me nice one  first off i bought it to play solitaire but the wife just liked it so this is the game we play together 90 out of 100 times good for coop tendremos que cooperar si queremos erradicar las enfermedades del planeta quarterbacking ruins this game but the only way to win is to have a cohesive strategy i do appreciate the difficulty scaling the original theme and how easy it is to introduce to new players great game and everyone helps each other viruses break out and you cure the diseases simpleright used to really enjoy this game but after about  plays it got kinda stale not a badly designed game by any stretch im just tired of the standard game now pandemic legacy is an amazing game after approx 6 plays my wife and i mid 30s parttime eurogamers with young kids think this is a good game just not one that we would like to play more than once in a great while in general we are not fans of coops exept for kids coop games that reduce the likelyhood of hard feelings developing betwen siblingsfriends so interpret my thoughts on pandemic with this in mind bottom line  we just dont understand the hype on this game my favorite coop however i have played so many games that i find myself wanting to explore newer games a good game but not the best boring game way overrated it is to easy when you work together well  classic and good coop my least favorite part of it is that its easily susceptible to an alpha player and i have a hard time not being that player cooperative games arent my cup of tea or else this would get a 7 this is a good game for new players because everybody is on the same team and you work as a group this game is very susceptible to the alpha gamer which is me in our grouphence why i dont like cooperative games dominating the entire group as with all cooperative games it suffers from the problem that losing to the game feels way worse than losing to a person if you play enough the game becomes predictable mildly enjoyable even though ive only won once in several plays i dont think its as great as everyone else says it is so the cult following is odd to me update   i love this game now improving strategy and coordination over time made the game better too much fun to say no to great cooperative all players paying full attention to no let anything gets out of control and it still gives some chills during the play place cubes remove cubes place them again great coop game ive gotten a little too good at it through a borrowed copy and then my brothers copy but hey thats what the expansion is for right  on the brink and in the lab good game i like the theme i like not having to fight the other players but work with them endgame is a little bit deceiving lack of tension played forbidden island before this love the chance as well as the strategy we only play on the hardest difficulty because the loosing makes people want to play again and do better great coop game but it hasnt hooked my gaming group excellent and tense game but for no apparent reason did not hold our interest for many replays got the warped board edition but still love this one m tico pandemic para m  el m ximo exponente de los juegos de mesa colaborativos de tablero con un gran escalado el despliegue en mesa es llamativo y suele interesar a la gente que est  empezando con los juegos de mesa lo mejor del juego es la tensi n en la que te mantiene durante toda la partida y lo bien que escala l stima su efecto l der i love this edition especially the coloured miniatures good game to play with family not too complex but steps into the realm of modern day board games good gateway game for inexperienced gamers i like this game its fun and a great introduction to proper board games but it doesnt hold up great over time particularly if you know it a lot better than the people youre playing with pretty dang fun i played with my wife and two friends we have a  win loss ratio but thats what make sit fun decent but there is better coop games forbidden desert for one with state of emergency in the lab just because im always lazy to turn the cardsand place the things p played twice lost twice but in the second go we were doing better than the first which i think shows we were getting a grip on strategy as a four player cooperative game it is basically a solo game which is split up for multiplayer there is a lot of luck in the shuffle and draw of the cards but it plays pretty fast so you can try again quickly there is a fun dimension to cooperative games as you have to decide strategy by argument and persuasion we won our last game i think we were fairly lucky with the cards i love challenging coop games and this one scales to 2player extremely well so far were not so great at it though hope no one was relying on us save the world f 14 4 cooperative i got this game to have something cooperative the whole family can play my wife doesnt enjoy highly competitive mean games she really enjoys this game we played it daily for a week when we first bought it wow we played this for the first time tonight and then turned around and played it seven more times ive now played it with everything from 2 to 4 players and it plays great albeit slightly differently with each number the game is quick under 45 minutes challenging and fun it plays a little differently each time an excellent game one of the best of the cooperative genre this is an odd game where no matter how many people are playing there really only feels like there is 1 player everyone is on the same team and trying to achieve the same goal if you have a gamer who like to hold everyones hand all the time it might come across as boring and it could feel like your watching them play the game by themselves i only play this game because its a great party game and other people love it its another one of those games for people who are unsure about board games but know they dont want to play monopoly for the 1 millionth time great cooperative game varied starting roles difficulty level and initial board setup allow for high replay value tense but not brain burning vous et votre compagnie  tes des membres tr s qualifi s d quipes de luttes contre les maladies menant

btarget  wifes birthdayb classic cooperative game though not sure how itll feel after going through pandemic legacy        purchased  i know many people love this game but i just dont get it im not a huge coop fan but this is about my least favorite coop it always seems tedious to me have played this twice still learning the rules but loving it big time going to play this a few more times before considering getting legacy after all these years im still torn on my opinion of pandemic on one hand i cannot like it that much as ive sought out many a replacement be it defenders of the realm or even something like zombie state in the end though ive lost interest in those alternatives while still not disliking pandemic i think perhaps my issue is in not having liked pandemic quite enough to have explored the expansions to which i hear the on the brink one can be considered quite essential perhaps it didnt exist back when i played it with others who were far bigger fans and perhaps we suffered too much from alpha gamers bossing us around at the time i do know that the base game by itself i dont really prefer vs forbidden desert which also has similar role cards and cooperative mechanics my wife also finds the theme of pandemic very morbid while our son tolerates it when i explain it differently i do prefer certain things about pandemic in the way outbreaks occur and are managed but at least in the 3 player game weve found it hard to eradicate a cured virus altogether such that it almost seems not worth the effort overall i think there is now a permanent place for it in our collection though along with pandemic lite forbidden desert and a pandemic thematic currently looking at defenders of the last stand so im hoping to think more highly of pandemic once i acquire some expansions and view it as more of an advanced game version odd to find a place for 3 different versions of the same game in a collection when none of them are particularly my favorite but i guess over time the pandemic sort of gameplay has become not unlike worker placement or deck building or something like that which is easily something youd have a few different versions of even if not quite your favorite thing i really like the new box cover art for the entire pandemic series nice job there the current editions bits looks really great as well and the card quality is perfect i think that might have helped my opinion of the game a little bit after pandemic legacy our favorite game includes on the brink  in the lab 14 58 765 243 45 s 28 74 just an awesome game and its great to play a coop game for a change approximately 20 plays in the last six weeks what can i say until the next big thing in coops hits the market i still love this one a few problems  bossing around others i am responsible sorry fellows is too easy and the theme somehow becomes a little stale after a few dozens plays id like to test defenders of the realms as a replacement but money is rare still playing it solo often  a good exercise in planning and reactivity takes only an half hour at worst easy to set amazing first coop game ever played and it was awesome i have enjoyed all the plays of this that ive had so far ive especially enjoyed it with 2 but its great with 3 as well received in trade so far so good the team truely feels like they are out for a common goal game feels organic edit as slick as the game design is it seems like it becomes a game of listen to the biggest a type or loudest person in your group probably not as bad as im making it sound it feels more like a puzzle in the end like with most coop games im not sure why it needs more than one player for the record ive never played solo this game sorta suffers like castle panic although harder it is still a coop game with a lot of dictation it is fun but just not as fun as competitive play there are a lot of things i like but i feel it is mostly in spite of the things i dont ive only played this game with the expansion but since i only use the pawns and new role cards from the expansion i dont really consider playing the old game with it because nothing has changed i love the roles and the powers they provide i love the research centers and the teamwork needed to do spread and conquer still what i dont like is the lack of satisfaction and climax at the end of the game when you win you feel like you should high five everyone around the table but it really doesnt come up i like the game from the components to the theme but it just misses the flare when you actually get into the game i personally think this game by itself should be a 7 at least making it a solid game i would play but not suggest however because of this game and the lack of excitement i get out of it it has put me off from buying defenders of the realm because of it ive been eyeing that game for a while and am saddened by this experience so much ive decided to hold off on that purchase and its expansion for the time being seeing as how this game is a more advanced coop game i was hoping it would push me towards a purchase of defenders of the realm however because it did the exact opposite i have to score it a point less at 6 because it has pretty much turned me away from the coop genre at least for now one of the better coop games ive played the games have always been tense and the game has plenty of meat for the relatively short time it takes to play either a really meaty filler or a serious short game depending on your group coop strategy ive played it and done several times and lost every way imaginable the game is a staple for anyone who even slightly enjoys coop board games great cooperative game in which you can loose in many ways but win just in one great game with a lot of strategic play and communication between players game is more for experience players i am not a big fan of coops but this is a relatively good game most of the time you can feel the tension and the feeling of helplessness which is a thematic plus production quality is fine and the game has solid mechanics i found the game easier with 2 players than with 4 so i recommend playing with more players as some of the tension is lost same sleeve size as mtg un gran juego adictivo y exelente juego para jugar en solitario lo  nico que le veo mal es el gran efecto lider que genera en grupos de jugadores pero es un juegazo y sus mecanicas con perfectas when i played this game with my wife she and i felt somethingspecial its very well made game it looks good for beginners     httpwwwnastolkinapolkerutagpandemic family favorite coop replacing castle panic one of the first cooperative games i played intensively with my wife thats why i have very fond memories of the game its simple a little luckheavy but you can minimize the luck and just right in terms of difficulty the original game and some of the expansions make for a thoroughly engaging cooperative experience but sometimes you end up with someone acting as quarterback its so hard i hate the theme of this game it has some really interesting mechanisms but i couldnt care less about the theme what is there to say about pandemic that has not already been said i love this game i really do however it can feel a little redundant after a couple of plays and as with most coop games you always run the risk of having an alpha player take over my biggest complaint is that sometimes you can feel like you never really have a turn even if there is no alpha player everyone is just always involved at all times which is part of the fun and partly what attracted me to the game and what i love about it but a side effect of that is that you never really feel like you are playing your turn theres no sense of personal ownership if that makes sense im looking forward to playing with some of the expansions and especially the legacy games to see how they change up gameplay this is a great introduction to cooperative games and it was actually my first foray into the hobby outside of monopoly and risk love it broken token crate pandemic in the lab pandemic on the brink pandemic state of emergency card sleeves this was originally an 8 then i got arkham horror rating 6 great game and great premise a modern classic the only issue i can think of is that sometimes cooperative games dont hit the spot which is not an issue with the game per se highly recommended and appeals to a widerange of players put aside your differences we have to save the world an enjoyable game for everyone pandemic allows for creative strategies and usually culminates with an intense finish try to avoid playing with someone xxtremely competitive who will try to tell everyone what to do on their turn i have recommended this game many times for a reason good game easy to teach and i enjoy it but it doesnt captivate me i believe this is a great gateway game one of my favorite games of all time it introduced me to what good coop board gaming can be like it scales well in terms of difficulty and number of players and ive found something about it fosters teamwork better than most other coops ive played ill always be down to play pandemic anytime anywhere i really like this game i think the mechanics work well with the theme and i love the theme contrary to debate i think that theres plenty of room for variation in play for the different roles and im always biting my nails at the end did not like the theme the tendency for alpha gaming or that we lost on a random card flip i was not impressed when i played it and now playing co op done right in spirit island this felt even worse muy buen juego cooperativo para jugar en familia never had a bad game yet always gripping with tension i still have yet to figure out why everyone loves this game i dont really like the coop thing one of the best fast paced cooperative games out there really enjoyable with the sense of coopearation between players and challenging even on the lowest difficulty though much of it depends on the roles you use during the game i just picked this up today222 from my flgs and im glad i ventured out to get it initial rating based on solitaire play this game is very cool and very tense for me tension is one of those high qualities in a game and this one works well even if youre all alone  im curious to see how it will play with others but unlike other card games this one does seem to work well solitaire my game ended with the red cubes exhausted and all i needed was one turn to get the scientist to tokyo do the cure with his four cards and boom there was still a chance but alas it was not meant to be cry somehow i think ill be playing this one quite a bit over the weekendupdate i finally won d however it was on the intro setting and i had only three cards left in the deck the next one being the fourth epidemic gulp what after 14 plays i am a dismal 311 shake but that is part of the appeal of this game the challenge of beating the system love it but i played it enough and sold it to buy pandemic legacy once we beat the virus at hardest level were not inclined to bring it back out and lose our status favorite game coop good with two players better with more the theme works really well easy to explain hard to master false sense of security will always get players game that begs to be played again after players have just lost only downside experienced players might overrule new players nm just dont get any sparks from coop loads of fun and coop to boot challenging and engaging you only seem to win with good cooperation good cooperative game lacks replayability once you figure it out good for about 10 games this game is an absolute blast on the edge of my seat every game very quick arcade type of a game pandemic starts to be interesting with first expansion because scenarios makes your games different in every way i m at the point always tempted to play pandemic with first expansion at least the best cooperative game ever fun frustrating interesting always spurs many ideas and conversational planning a little bit overrated but still really good also it is quite good for nongamers too i did play this with a wide range of different type of people and everyone enjoyed it on the other hand i would not play this anymore without adding at least one expansion while not as exciting as shadows over camelot i am tickled pink about the cooperative element in this game its tough really tough and the mechanics of the virus spreading are tremendous excellent action sequencing game with interesting spatial element that plays well at all player counts a well balanced challenge   coop familystrategy game   colorhand managementcolor  colorset collectioncolor   gateway to coop game   good theme   ok artwork   good components   replayability

to spend playing games  played a solo game a while ago and it was quite fun i have discovered through various playthroughs though that i am not really as big a fan of pandemic as i thought i was i much prefer other games in my collection  this game is brilliant in all the areas that count it is a fantastically designed game and one that must have been truly groundbreaking when it came out for me the mechanisms involved in the epidemic cards were a moment where my brain almost exploded in how simple and clever it was in spite of my awe over the design of the game it is not a favourite and rarely gets played these days if you have a group of 4 and want something a little different this game can play really well strategy wise its not the greatest you work as a team to fight a virus and you just move around and cure diseases not the hardest game it is fun in that when the viruses spread it can become quite hard to contain them we take this out every couple of months not in our top 10 but not the worst if you are looking to compete against other players this is not the game for you overall not a bad game and at a low price point now good addition to any collection i didnt like coup game and this is the first experiece to me partidas ganadasperdidas picassojac 10 oca 12 navir 13 alvaro 01 pepon 01 alba 02 felipe 03 games magazine best family game   tric trac dargent silver bgg golden geek award  best family game cooperativo y elegante a favourite among my casual gaming circle great streamlined puzzle appropriate theme that works but not fluffy by any means gets played relatively frequently i love this game it can get really tense sometimes which makes it so fun after youve beaten the game a few times it does feel repetitive though its the kind of game you want to and look forward to playing again but with a different group of people because once youve beaten the game with those people youre satisfied and dont feel the need to play it again  paz  rubicopl allegropl   z   family i played it on a board games festival in brzeg for the first time and i totally had to buy it after that i played it for some times and i want to play it more and more the coolest thing about it is that players does not fight each other they fight the game itself together played once a 3 player game on easy while there are clever mechanics here that quite nicely simulate the spread of a disease and the game design can be quite challenging it does not feel like playing a game nor quite like a puzzle you are not pitting your wits against a sentient thing as in an opponent in a regular board game or against an ai in a computer game both of which are much more satisfying no here you are playing against fate who delivers its moves through a semirandom card draw i say semirandom as there are mechanics in the game to make the same cities come up again all you can do is play your hand as dealt the best you can and it is not superior play in overcoming an opponent that allows you to win but random fortune and although there is a nice simulation here i did not feel that i was getting a narrative flow of a story unfolding here but more of a desperate do what we can each turn and hope for the best i would not refuse to play it again nor any other coop game but it would not be my suggestion should not have given it up  didnt realize how popular it would become and how much emily liked to play it our 18year old seniors favorite he thought because we won once that we had mastered it three player with random roles he soon learned that wasnt the case and only using 4 infection cards this is how we prove that he puts out lousy effort on his homework if you can figure out pandemic you can certain get better than a c on routine assignments fantastic cooperative game and very interesting how different players see the board good fun but can get a bit samey wonderful game cooperative gateway familyweight a fun design but gets old fast too much sharing can ruin the game and just make it a group solitaire event this a great challenging coop game which plays lovely with 2 3 as well as 4 players the theme mechanics and also game play are exciting after we are finished i always feel like playing another round due to the design game rarely goes over 45 minutes so it never feels long or boring  you are always on your toes to see whether you manage to win the only critique is in regards to roles some of the have obvious advantage but others are not that easy to leverage by beginners quite fun cooperation game despite my general dislike for coop games this one really shows my bias coop and me do not get along still solid ages well  solid cooptoo easy for one player to take charge etc i know i have a hit game when at the end the players demand to play again they dont ask nicely they demand especially when we lose hadnt played in quite a while and then did with some good friends excellent game that still holds up tension collaboration discussion and groans as we lose the world to the black plague good game to introduce newer gamers to coops though i prefer to play defenders of the realm i enjoy the gameplay of this one but i cant stand the arbitrary end condition i want the game to end thematically not just because some pile of cards has run out this may sound minor but it basically ruins a good game for me id much rather play flash point i dont think i will ever truly love any cooperative game but this is intriguing and difficult enough to warrant a lot of plays fun but entirely coop games make the more strategic player in the group play all the turns of all the players p 14  4 a 8 w 242 t 45 g strategy cooperative on the brink pp regalo de edu y almu  gracias great game but almost not worth playing with others it is too cooperative easy to fall into alpha gaming pryors every turn there is a very apparent optimal move and every turn you are either the player telling everyone else what to do or your being told what your optimum move would be by someone else repeat ad nauseum typical coop game does a good job of requiring players to work together and gives variable player powers a pretty good game but i just cant see myself playing this one all that often i think the moves are little too obvious and the play is too predicated on the card draws legacy ruined this game for me after so many games of that in a row see no reason to play this anymore 2nd purchase a very tense fun exciting game february  sold to friend after pandemic legacy season 1 and 2 i just dont have a desire to go back and play this one not big on coops but this is one of the few i enjoy pretty nice and well themed coop game 26 definitely less excited to play this now than i used to be especially after getting through pandemic legacy which was great and having dead of winter on hand which to me is a more fun version of this game might still be good to keep around to introduce new people to but definitely not one that ill suggest myself on a regular basis rating will change with more play meh also a pure coop not my favorite style of game 4 comprado en  after playing some today one of the guys commented that at the end of a won game it feels a little anticlimatic i can see where he is coming from there are no moments that feel exciting i never want to say man when you went to milan and essen to cure those diseases that was really cool solo game is not as compelling to me as other games in my colelction but if i have some friends over and we want a fast game this is probably the one that hits the table as is very easy to play and is quite fun my first coop and a lot of fun simple and elegant mechanics and adjustable difficulty make this a solid game that comes out very often on our regular game nights very fun game with a lot of variants easy to teach to casual gamers and still challenging enough for hardcore gamers a fun thematic coop that escalates tension nicely its generally more fun to play with open information and discuss moves as a group even if this is not strictly allowed in the rules the infection mechanism in which the discard pile is placed on top of the draw deck is at once innovative thematic and simple the on the brink expansion is superb and i never play without at least some of it kids are picking it up after a couple of plays rating previous to feb  95 rating previous to oct  875 rating previous to june  734 seems like one person mostly tells everyone else what to doprobably more suitable as a solitare game excellent coop really clever mechanics good theme a work of art replay value is decent but eventually you will get tired of it thankfully it has a lot of expansions which brings new life to the game a must have coop game good good game wife loves it a very good go to game when everyone is standing around with the well what do you want to play look on their faces no one ever says oh i dont want to play that fun experience but depends on the group a bit puzzly sometimes for me i also beat it often son loves it so play it often the alternate spreading and curing of disease is very rewarding 24 fr re   favorite lost during the  move to efrat game is rather repetitive addremove diesease cubes and alpha player dictating the entire game puppets playing solitaire pandemic is a very clever design and really does a good job portraying its subjectmatter fun little game with no replayability after 56 games it is all the same i doubt ill get the expansions because their value is abysmally small the idea of this game is awesome cooperating with your friends to rid the world of disease sounds like my kind of game and to top it all off every player has their own special skills to contribute to the team i love it the thing that makes this game not fun are players like myself i am a total dictator im the person who introduced the game to my friends and so automatically i fell into the teaching role but theres a fine line between teacher and dictator i cross that line i spend all game telling people what to do before people even take their turn im giving them suggestions and when they dont follow my suggestions i tell them how inefficient their turn was and how we will all fail because of them i should just play this game solo there needs to be some sort of rule or mechanic that prevents people like me from controlling the entire game i cant seem to win at this even on the easiest difficulty im not sure whether to give up on this game or keep trying the problem with losing is that im losing against a deck of cards so it never feels like ive been outsmarted or outplayed in any way i probably wouldnt play this with a group since coop games can get a bit dictatorial the fact that this game is so hard makes me less inclined to share the experience i think the only reason im keeping this is because it can be played solo on the rare occasion when theres no one around to game with and given all the hype over this i feel like maybe one day everything will just click and ill start winning bon jeu de coop ration joli mat riel nous y jouons   2 14 4 60 initial impression 9 very fun i have the expansions but only played the base game so far a lot of fun trying to overcome the spread of cubes very accessible coop that can serve as a gateway lots of replayability here 10th anniversary edition i dont really like this game due to the possibility of the alpha gamer takeover why not just play it solo but this edition is really pretty production decoration excellent puzzle driven coop that forces players to make tough decisions and run the risk of the next outbreak flop character powers add a nice touch granting unique strategies for each participant at game set up excellent cooperative gameplay a definite challenge if we ever want to win the ultimate coop save the world from plaque plays very similar to forbidden island i love the theme and the rules are intuitive again easy enough for nongamers to enjoy and this is a family fave there is quite a bit of luck involved as some games are over in about 5 turns we just maniacally laugh about the poor doomed population and play again super fun cooperative game challenging but nothing unachievable kjartan has this great group cooperative game can be done as 2 player best as group liked this one a lot  but i would assume it depends on who you are playing with i apparently played with the right people first coop game for me and i was surprised that it was so good and challenging beeing a microbiologist myself i just love the theme would love to try the expansion on the brink as well good quality components mechanics are fun and they keep you on the edge you will need the right set of people to play this game 3august  one of my favorite brainburning coops we played it a lot before i started logging plays absolutely fabulous even my wife loves this game which is a great commendation in itself includes  state of emergency  on the brink very good coop game love the theme i dont like cooperative games so much but this one i like easy to play difficult to win initially the game didnt really look that interesting but after a few playthroughs it is really fun and made me eat my words it plays very fast so its a good icebreaker to begin the night incredible implementation of of variable player powers far far better than defenders of the realm tr s immersif et stressantapres on termine toujours avec un zombicide  i find this one boring i also find forbidden island dull but at least theres less hullaballoo in it my dissatisfaction with these two specific games has to do with either something in the nature of coops or in the specific way that the disaster events are actuated by reshuffling the discard deck i thought it was the former since i didnt have fun the one time i played flash point either but then i played hanabi and really liked it maybe its that you can probably play forbidden island pandemic and flash point as solitaire games and in a group it ends up being hive mind solitaire but by its nature hanabi must be played with other people color117bc0bid probably rather playbcolor forbidden island but i dont like that one either ive yet to beat this one hope to mark that off my list soon all decisions feel either meaningless or obvious not for me great intro game but doesnt really feel new each time its played and so isnt worth 40min of play would like to replace this with infection express someday this game continues to drop down in the ratings for meits just bleh a great coop its easy to be too confident when everything seems under control and then be caught by surprise when the deck runs out it usually takes a few rounds with the same group until were able to win which is about the right difficulty especially for casual gamers who often find harder coops frustrating there are also rules to adjust the difficulty which is a great microbadgemicrobadge  of players bgcolor00cc00 2 3 b4bbgcolor what can i say about ole pandemic my new collection wouldnt be the same without it its easily our most played game i usually would chose competitive games over coop games but this game made me a lover of the genre i love how at any given moment things can go straight to hell good coop game but it seemed like our group figured it out and it hasnt hit the table since each player has a role and together the table needs to maximize the use of those roles  exact date not sure gave approximate number of plays interesting the way that the diseases spread otherwise not much to see here i find the moves to be obvious and the game can beat you on dumb luck of the 4th epidemic card being pulled yawn the king of this style coop game it feels like the the mechanics are closely tied with the theme in spite of the reality that the game is very abstracted what do your cards represent exactly theyre used for both travel and for researching cures it can be cinematic it can be tense its filled with discussion about what to do the different powers play off each other in interesting ways you feel like a group of heroic researchers saving the world  works great solo as well decent game i do not see the need to ever own it its always nice to cooperate w friends to try to save the world would love to be able to play as a disease though ive never been a big fan of coop games since you are playing against the game and games are not capable of making rational decisions the game has to rely on random chance and being unpredictable in order to avoid being solved by the players this tends toward a higher randomness aspect that i dont enjoy only one play looks neat and very simple but also dry and prone to ap and not quite sure we saw what we were doing wrong when we lost sure id play it again but as usual i dont see what all the fuss is about beautifully produced fantastic game that allows the whole family to play together on the same team the children can win with their parents instead of always getting outsmarted by them my family is eagerly waiting for the expansion i just dont like coop games all that much but as coop games go this is just about the best ill play if thats the game everyone else wants to play otherwise no its quickness improves its rating played 4x in the first sitting and thought it was pretty neat french edition with expansions   not a bad game but it rewards alpha player behavior far too much and when it comes down to it is probably more dependent on the cards than player actions its still somewhat fun but it hasnt held up well for me after multiple plays pandemic is a good game made tremendously better with the expansion a little easier overall than i anticipated could definitely become boring quickly if overplayed a coop classic of fighting worldwide epidemics a great intro to cooperative gaming for many myself included main downside the less vocal members of the group can often feel like theyre just watching in my experience 73 really requires everyone to play like one player only optimal moves best cooperative game ive ever played japanese version weight 241  5 45 min xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 14 4 community 10 solo sleeved 635 x 88mm 2 12 x 3 12  118 we like pandemic but it tends to come out more with company over coops are great the epidemics stress me out my favorite coop although i did not appreciate in the lab the additional roles were worth the money with a few additional characters from any other expansion makes a good game even better love it caja de aniversario this game is fun and has a great theme ive tired of it a bit lately but played with the in the lab expansion and it opens new possibilities had first play on 30 oct  the gameplay was a pleasant surprise the game was good and tense throughout had a game with baboo the players were kept engaged throughout the game the game has a good level of tension built in cant wait to play the expansion thx steve b based playing the base edition no expansions a great gateway coop game that i have enjoyed every time i have played it very simple to teach but enough challenge and options per turn that keeps it interesting for more veteran players the different roles also help give each game a different enough dynamic ive also played it 15 times solo and it always kept me engaged i own the expansions but im waiting for the base game to feel stale until i use them after 24 plays the fun has been sucked out of the game i love the theme coop medium its not the first cooperative game but its the one that put coops on the map figuratively and practically and spawned a universe of great pandemic games and expansions 2p super fun game when you play with others and not against others i like how the difficultly ramps up pretty easily  so this isnt just a feel good everybody wins all the time game you have to work for it i suppose it says something about me that i dont find cooperative board games to be particularly compelling in a word  gentle family game integration of theme  little basically an abstract depthweight ratio  moderate quite light in each aspect i enjoyed this one a lot one two player game played and we lost but had fun along the way look forward to trying with larger groups and more special abilities of the various coop games ive played so far this one is definitely my favorite board game  mine  cooperative favorite of michele and me first game we bought cards starting to get worn out from too much play guesstamation on plays before  but around  all but one or two were 2 player during that time looking forward to buying expansion purchased  for me this is one of the special gateway games for friends regalado a mi sobrina mar a unleash the epidemic fight it conquer it you saved the world  realy lacks replayability and the most experienced player will dominate the whole game making it not that fun for other players absolutely fantastic cooperative game and the one that introduced us to the genre totally thematic very tense this game is just about our sweet spot played twice loved it looking to go legacy contagious and addictive thanks a lot secret santa  im the only one i know who doesnt love pandemic i am not a big fan of coop games in general i can appreciate the game and will play it if everyone else wants to but have no desire to play it do not let go  from bob used to be my favorite game to bring to the table with new gamers but now theres mechs vs minions and mysterium excellent coop gateway game to get your friends invested into board games great cooperative strategy although it can be difficult for newbies to get into the game if there is someone particularly controlling playing as well as is tragically so often the case with coop games very difficult to win if you dont work together cooperative games have never been my favorite but this one has an unique theme when compared to the rest of the board game world i love playing the base game of pandemic with my husband andor 8yearold son it reminds me of how much i loved the legacy versions found out with this one that my group isnt into pure coop games trade priority  very likely to trade this game away 8 plays this game is popular and the theme is interesting to me however ive not been able to win a game even on the easiest setting with any number of players or different groups i feel like i must be missing a rule or not approaching the problem correctly part of me wants to set this game on the shelf but at the same time i enjoy playing it even when we lose nice introduction to coop games not for us too many games with alphaplayers love this game an all time favorite for sure easy to learn hard to master  nice game with this one try again effect the best coop game i have seen so far it is easy and even with a high luck factor it still makes fun just to retry update  reduced 76 it is a good game but i dont really intend to play it ever again update  to 3 do not want to play it ever again something like time stories will always be my choice for a coop family game will play if asked at a party but prefer many other games not bad didnt grab me but cooperative games havent to date still its the best cooperative game ive played to me cooperative games are like a bunch of people sharing a game of solitaire update nov  my wife and son really like coop games so this game has been popular recently it is a great family game based on 1 four player game unique design with a good coop challenge artwork and theme are fun didnt take too long and was easy to learn not sure its one ill go out of my way to play but would like to try again soon could increase score r for me its better than legacy version  not so fiddly and you dont need to play multiple samey session in a row bundled with pandemic on the brink and the litko virus tokens 39 accessory httpwwwlitkonetproductsvirustokensethtmlvgdvxfpfzc excellent cooperative game also family friendly and a good introduction for nongamers great design and fairly thematic but prone to having alpha player issues would recommend only for groups with chill players of equal level of gaming experience old version have old expansions like plain or with them annoyed with zman games for not makingoffering upgraded cards to older game ownersafter several emails to the company im left with the opinion that it is not a friendly company it was awesome the first time fun the second good the third and then well it just gets old very quick and really enjoyable i worry it might become a little scripted after repeat play great game great cooperative play thematic too been playing it whilst in lockdown during covid19 outbreak of  24 players very fun coop game that i think i could teach anyone who is willing to try it out want to play this one a bit more and at a more standard game level and then see how the cthulhu variant plays as i prefer cthulhu mythos a lot then it will be on to legacy version with a couple other family members to see how we do this game is a lovely coop and i think the rating may go up i dont think that every game is solvable  certainly not at higher difficulties and this has sometimes bothered me a bit  but i am not sure if that really should bother me so long as it is still possible to improve the odds of winning by clever play and it certainly is a game of skill in that sense a great game one that beats me and my gaming group on a regular basis but that i still want to play again bud pp pandemic alone is a lot of fun but i find it really needs the on the brink expansion that elevates it tremendously im not happy with the 3rd expansion requiring me to buy compatibility decks so i may not get it at all great with semigamers i first started playing this numerous times with my friends sean and becky its what i consider to be a classic coop game though i really enjoyed pandemic legacy considerably more i played forbidden islanddesert and arkham horror long before i played this one and so when i finally did the mechanisms were very intuitive my wife and i have since played this many times and enjoy it a lot though i think we are ready to move on to the legacy games at this point its a great design but the simplicity of the original game eventually catches up to it and slightly overwhelms the replayability 2 3 4 players 45 minutes just love to play it i like the coup thinking but took some practice to win more than loose 24 players 60m wt 23 tt 42 rare language intensive cards can easily be translated by any player chalet the classic coop and the game that got me back into board gaming  has a special place in my heart plus on the brink expansion have played this a lot especially solo while on the road a great game great for playing with my young boy too wife likes it too pandemic is a great game that i would always play it isnt for everyone though so i might not recommend it to every individual 2  4 players version with two new professions just love this game will play anytime like the in the lab expansion the best a thematic and fun coop puzzler with some clever mechanisms though i didnt find it to be the mindblowing experience i was led to believe very good game highly thematic plenty of interaction plenty of failure but everything to make you want to play again great fun very easy to learn ill use this little coop as gateway to arkham horror  great game not played as much as i would like to the coop thing isnt something one is always in the mood for alpha gamer problem unacceptable in  what an excellent game that lives up to the hype and then some played twice with 4 players on easy but still couldnt win need to figure the best way to cure diseases as fast as possible rated a 9 but could trend as low as 7 if i find the winning to be too random i want to know that there is more skill to the game than luck until i get disheartened though i will love this game played 2 player with heather and enjoying this game even more she is not as enamored with it but i want this to be a game we pull out quite often 9 is still appropriate  its a simple coop game but im never excited to play it easy this is a solitaire game playing coop adds nothing to the experience you just need to consult other people to make your turn and if you dont coordinate you will lose ok for its time but does not hold up too much abstraction the rules dont evoke the theme except for the spread of the infection too much of a soulless optimization puzzle dry pandemic is a fun coop game that everyone at least that ive introduced it to loves i definitely enjoyed it a lot the first couple times i played it too thinking about it currently though i dont really have a desire to play maybe ive just been in a weird mood recently but it has definitely dropped off my radar the ingame chaos is definitely great but i think that the progression gets a bit old at least to me i really enjoy games that throw me unpredictable twists and while the placement of the outbreak cards are somewhat unpredictable the outbreak system is really the only bit of randomness you find objectively i can recognize that i may end up revisiting this game in a year or so praising it for the exact reason im currently knocking it however im currently looking for a really expansive complex experience definitely not the point of pandemic and i think its making me unnecessarily hard on pandemic since im holding it to the standards of this yet undiscovered game sorry for the ramble there though pandemic is a great game for just about anyone i can recognize that for sure its also why i rated it an 8 and am sitting here getting frustrated with it if you dont own it get it its absolutely worth having on hand i love this game the cooperative aspect is a lot of fun but the odds are against the players and a win is difficult for more than 3p its easier to win with two players its a pretty quick game it can be easily lost in minutes this game sees our table regularly the on the brink expansion is a definite must for anyone who likes the base game we found the in the lab expansion useless but some of the options for state of emergency are pretty interesting rating goes up with expansions must have the petri dish expansion great coop game sometimes the setup can deter me from bringing out but always have a good time excellent gateway game also one of the better coops so far easy to learn high replay value wonderful coop number one game for my wife it explains all obviously one of the earliest and popular coop games a great innovation in its time 48 a classic i have all the expansions keeper just ok i dont seem to enjoy coop games very much sold at dundracon  pandemic is a great game you want teamwork well thats pandemic it has no tricks no weird mechanisms or anything its just a great teamwork game it plays in 45 minutes or so and not a single one is wasted 14 4 save the world no big deal nice teamplay another game mechanic than most of the games have something different httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk5k19zhwsqg i don t reach for pandemic as often as i should really we need to start pushing ourselves by upping the difficulty maybe if i get an expansion or two i ll feel the drive to play this game more and really get to know the game it would be nice to feel versed enough in the base game to venture into the legacy series and see what all the buzz is about with meeplesource character and germ upgrades my first new board game first cooperative game i played also have the first expansion both woriginal art ireally enjoy playing this cooperative game even when im playing it alone just 3 plays edit  over 15 plays now and i still consider this a good game but over rated here on bgg imho fun cooperative game need to try it with the expansion first coop and i love it different difficulty makes it more interesting may be too much of brain burner to play at night like a fine wine this game just gets better with age ive found its a big hit when ive played it with nongamers fun  7 replay  7 component  3 theme  5 i have played a couple times i have found it to be frustrating but in a fun way theres a sudden outbreak of infectious new diseases were the ones to help you not obama god nor jesus dans les premiers jeux achet s depuis que jai recommenc    jouer un jeu excellent difficile mais qui te donne un sentiment quil sera possible dy arriver un coop que je joue   loccasion seul possibilit  quen coop un joueur domine les autres microbadge includes  on the brink u06febu i think this was the fist coop game i played after getting into the hobby and it has spiraled from there first i do enjoy working together with the other players to defeat the game i dont have trouble with the alpha player problem since i only play with my family and on the rare occasion my two buddies second i enjoy the puzzle aspect of most coop games that is something that attracts me in games and finally and probably most importantly i can play them solo controlling any number of players so what about this one in particular i think its fantastic i like the theme of fighting against ever spreading diseases around the world i like all of the various roles especially when you include the on the brink expansion the ai deck is a fantastic and brutal mechanism to play against as it continues to add more and more trouble on the map the replayability is very high in my opinion as the set up varies from game to game roles mix and match in interesting ways the difficulty level can be adjusted and with on the brink three additional options can be added to the base set of rules to really liven things up i really cant say anything negative about this game however i think you can give yourself help if you count cards personally i dont do that of course ill have a general idea of what may be coming up next but i try not to memorize everything that has happened with the ai deck and what is still to come i like being surprised and that tension of not exactly knowing what will happen next maybe thats just me u24janu man i cant believe its been six months since ive played thiswhat is wrong with me such a great coop game i still hold this one in high regard even though so many coops have arrivedand landed in my collectionsince i would easily recommend this one to any gamer new or otherwise interested in a solid challenging coop experience oh and definitely pick up the first expansion for additional options and even more replayability lots of fun so far cooperative games are an interesting change of pace this game must be on every top 10 board game to start playing its really okay maybe because its a classic or maybe its just not for me i didnt enjoy it much when i played it it felt like a puzzle i didnt want to solve i love playing this game with my son it scales well and with the expansion it is always challenging the high quality of the figures and cards along with a larger game board takes this already great game from great to near perfect but the missing connection it really takes this down quite a notch awesome game we have acquired it recently and played it like a hundread times already go for itis outstanding edit played it with the expansionhoaaaa gold standard for coop games on the brink expansion makes it even better this game looks interesting and different but one person invariably directs the actions of the team while the others sit and watch the game get played i think its a great design for ramping up a tense experience but its a game ive rarely found to be fun over the many times ive played it and would much rather play forbidden island for something quick or defenders of the realm which is thematically much more interesting pretty basic game i play with my nongamers group but i feel im already bored of the game still stay in my collection because of how simple it plays and most people enjoy it played i like it but my cooperative game of choice is flash point fire rescue not bad solo my wife loves this game working together is always a nice change of pace our cat doesnt attack the pieces like he does with plastic bits weve been using the on the brink expansion ever since we acquired it in early  this will always be a favorite of mine perfect introductory cooperative game a lot of people have left this for pandemic legacy but sometimes you just want to save the world once and move on weve worn the cards almost completely out a really great puzzletype game experience absolutely have to avoid playing this with an alpha player will suck every bit of fun out of it have played this two player twice great game great tension easy to learn but you need to read the rules carefully very well done cooperative game i dont seem to like cooperative games though purchased my copy at gamescape store in san francisco usa 3 i gave this a good game but played it a lot i think legacy pretty much replaced this one for me although when you finish pandemic legacy your pretty much done with that also another favorite coop i tend to like ghost stories just a little more i love cooperative board games and this one is in the sweet spot difficulty wise for me you win some and you lose some plus i love the theme and components love this game the tension that rises as you work together to fight off the diseases is so exciting when you add in the extra expansions which i highly recommend then the game gets even more exciting and more thematic only down side is the alpha gamer tendency which is so prevalent with coops not being a fan of cubes i did pimp out my game with the virus counters from etsy highly recommend i also own the expansions in the lab on the brink  fun cooperative game can be very difficult to win but this is a lot of fun and can be played solitaire the best cooperative i know this was before gloomhaven ill leave it for historical reasons now its the best fast cooperative game i know good for everybody and still a lot of fun for veterans perfect amount of challenge theme working very well diseases are spreading and your group of experts is on a mission to contain the infection and to find a cure so satisfying to be together against all odds great gateway drug err game was very entertaining after several games it became way too easy to win the game even on the hardest level puzzle  solved replayability  gone i love pandemic got me into the hobby haven t played for about a year now but i played atleast 30 times before seeking other coops haven t played since the legacy experiences still one of the best cooperative games out there i gave it a nine just because ive only had this game for a few days so far we love it my wife likes it because it doesnt involve weapons or warfare my young son likes being able to make important decisions and i like it because a they do b its just a really enjoyable and wellmade game p 85 ill be back when you finish making my move whoooooollly  wow  batman  this game is good definetely one of the best cooperative games fast and infection mechanism is just brilliant a great coop game but sometimes it feels like a puzzle ive already solved s awka there are two clever mechanics here 1shuffling and returning all used cards on the top of the pile after an epidemic so that already infected cities receive additional disease cubes later 2spreading the extra disease cubes in neighboring cities the rest of the game is not that great hoped that all actions would be helpful and every turn would be full of meaningful decisions but your first and only priority is to make the color sets for the cures as soon as possible everything else fighting diseases traveling etc that consumes precious turnscards draws you away from victory and should only be used as last resort cooperative games are a hit or miss with many people some adore them many hate them and refuse to play they want competition and tension between players i cant get enough games with this game solid game but its hard to go back after playing legacy the puzzle is fun to solve but its prone to quarterbacking i can only really play it with family nowadays tldr a huge success with good reason i remember this game being announced there was no buzz i was working for a distributor or zman titles at the time so i ordered just a couple of cases i had requested preorders from shops there were very few the day the games arrived though the game was sold out so i contacted zev to order more he had sold out he told me he had printed  a very normal print run at the time so this game went from no buzz to the hype of the moment in no time and it seems to still be growing with all these variations and expansions coming out in any case ive never been a fan of coops and i probably never will be i dont hate them but i just prefer some healthy competition that being said i think this is still my favorite coop of the ones ive played duh i think it has the perfect balance of amount of rules play time and complexity for all experience levels most coops have some variation of the ifthishappensresolvethisrandomeventcardmechanism pandemic kind of has that with the epidemic cards but other games like thingthing have way more of that if feels kind of like a lame way to throw problems at the players to me but the sparce way it is implemented in pandemic is perfect theres only a little bit of it but the tension it creates is great also this game is pretty streamlined and usually takes less than an hour all in all very good though not my favorite rating  bgg scale 710 14 setup separate the disease cubes by color into 4 supply piles place the outbreaks marker on the 0 space of the outbreaks track the infection rate marker on the leftmost space 2 of the infection rate track and the 4 cure markers  vial  side up near the discovered cure indicators shuffle the role cards and deal one faceup to each player each player takes a reference card and places his matching pawn in atlanta place 1 research station in atlanta take the epidemic cards out of the player deck and set them aside shuffle the other player cards city and event cards and deal the following number to each of the players to form their initial hands 4 players 2 cards 3 players 3 cards 2 players 4 cards set the desired difficulty of the game introductory 4 epidemic cards standard 5 cards heroic 6 cards remove unused epidemic cards from the game divide the remaining player cards into a number of facedown piles equal to the number of epidemic cards as equal in size as possible shuffle an epidemic card into each pile and stack the piles to form the player deck place smaller piles on the bottom shuffle the infection cards and flip over 3 of them put 3 disease cubes of the matching color on each of these cities flip over 3 more cards and put 2 disease cubes on each of these cities flip over 3 more cards and put 1 disease cube on each of these cities all these cards go faceup on the infection discard pile the other infection cards form the infection deck players look at the city cards they have in hand the player with the highest city population goes first game sequence play proceeds clockwise players may advise each other but the player whose turn it is decides what to do each turn the current player must 1 do 4 actions select any combinations of the available actions an action may be performed more than once each time counting as one action you may pass an action unused actions cannot be saved from turn to turn your role may change how an action is completed 2 draw 2 player cards draw 2 cards from the player deck if the card is an epidemic card follow the epidemic rules if there aren t enough cards to draw the game immediately ends in defeat for all players 3 infect cities draw cards from the infection draw pile equal to the current infection rate and add 1 cube of the color of each card to the pictured cities 1 actions movement actions drive  ferry move to a city connected by a white line to the one you are in lines  wrap around  the board direct flight discard a city card to move to the city named on the card charter flight discard the city card that matches the city you are in to move to any city shuttle flight move from a city with a research station to any other city that has a research station other actions build a research station discard the city card that matches the city you are in to place a research station there if all 6 stations have been built take one from anywhere on the board treat disease remove 1 disease cube from the city you are in and place it back in the supply if this disease color has been cured remove all cubes of that color from the city you are in if the last cube of a cured disease is removed from the board this disease is eradicated flip its cure marker to its side share knowledge give or take the city card that matches the city you are in to or from another player the other player must be in the city with you a player who now has more than 7 cards must immediately discard a card or play an event card discover a cure at any research station discard 5 city cards of the same color from your hand to cure the disease of that color however its cubes remain on the board and new ones can still be placed move the disease s cure marker to its cure indicator if no cubes of this color are on the board the disease is eradicated flip its cure marker to its side roles the contingency planner may as an action take an event card from anywhere in the discard pile and place it on his role card only one may be there at a time and it does not count against his hand limit when he plays the card remove it from the game instead of discarding it the dispatcher may as an action either move any pawn if its owner agrees to any city containing another pawn or move another player s pawn if its owner agrees as if it were his own when taking a direct or charter flight discard cards from his hand when taking a charter flight the card played must match the city the pawn is moving from the medic removes all cubes of the same color with the treat disease action if a disease has been cured he automatically removes all cubes of that color from a city by entering it or being there this does not take an action this can occur on other players  turns the medic also prevents placing disease cubes and outbreaks of cured disease in his location the operations expert may as an action either build a research station in his current city without discarding or using a city card or once per turn move from a research station to any city by discarding any city card the dispatcher may not use the operation expert s special move ability when moving the operation expert s pawn the quarantine specialist prevents both outbreaks and the placement of disease cubes in the city he is in and all cities connected to that city the researcher may as an action give any city card from his hand to another player in the same city without this card having to match the city the transfer must be from his hand to the other player s hand but it can occur on either player s turn the scientist only needs 4 city cards of the same disease color to discover a cure for that disease 2 draw cards epidemic cards when an epidemic card is drawn take the following steps in order 1 increase move the infection rate marker forward 1 space on the infection rate track 2 infect take the bottom card from the infection deck unless its disease color has been eradicated put 3 disease cubes of that color on the named city if the city already has cubes of this color add enough cubes so that it has 3 of this color then an outbreak occurs discard the card to the infection discard pile 3 intensify reshuffle just the cards in the infection discard pile and place them on top of the infection deck if 2 epidemic cards are drawn at once complete all 3 steps once and then again events can be played after resolving the first epidemic after resolving any epidemic cards remove them from the game do not draw replacement cards for them hand limit players have a hand limit of 7 cards if you have more after resolving any epidemic cards discard cards or play event cards until you have 7 cards in hand 3 infections flip over a number of cards from the infection deck one at a time equal to the current infection rate below the space on the infection rate track with the infection marker cities are infected in the order drawn infect the city named on each card by placing 1 matching disease cube onto the city unless the disease has been eradicated if the city already has 3 cubes of this color instead of adding a 4th cube an outbreak occurs there discard the card to the infection discard pile outbreaks each time a disease outbreak occurs move the outbreaks marker forward 1 space on the outbreaks track then place 1 cube of the disease color on every city connected to the city if any of them already has 3 cubes of the disease color in each of them a chain reaction outbreak occurs after the current outbreak is done when a chain reaction outbreak occurs move the outbreaks marker forward 1 space then place cubes as above except do not add a cube to cities that have already had an outbreak or chain reaction outbreak during the current infection card resolution cards event cards event cards may be played at any time even on another player s turn except in between drawing and resolving a card they do not require an action to play the player who plays an event card decides how it is used after playing an event card discard it to the player discard pile player cards when playing the introductory game place your cards facup in front of you in the standard and heroic games cards are kept private only player cards count towards your hand limit role and reference cards are not part of your hand the discard piles may be examined at any time game end defeat the game immediately ends in defeat for all players if any of the following occur 1 you are unable to place the number of disease cubes actually needed on the board 2 the outbreaks marker reaches last space of the outbreaks track 3 a player cannot draw 2 player cards after doing his action victory players collectively win the game immediately when the cures to all 4 diseases are discovered players do not need to eradicate all 4 diseases to winjust cure them fast and fun and easy for nongamers to enjoy as long as you dont have an overbearing player in the group pandemic is a quick and challenging game grandfather of cooperative games and still fantastic to solo even up to 4 characters is not too fiddly and expansions add a ton of content setup is a little longer sleeves fantasy flight played 4 in a row yesterday and i think ill be playing this one a lot in the coming months we managed to beat the game twice once on the intro difficulty and once on the normal difficulty then we figured out that we were playing it wrong and we lost the last 2 horribly man this game is tough great game highly recommended definitely an enjoyable coop dont think i need to add anything about pandemic that hasnt been said before excellent gateway gamemy 8 year old loved playing this game the most soulless game i ever seen rus   pandemic  99                                     4           2                           5                                                                                                                                                                               6   10                               challenging and solid cooperative game that is reminiscent of forbidden island and forbidden desert yet demands a lot more careful thought vulnerable to alpha gaming but should be enjoyable with the right group great mechanics great theme especially with in the lab expansion awesome coop play that is always challenging but never over the top hard great game mechanics means that you honestly feel this game is thinking for itself still a great coop there was a time when pandemic fell out of favor from me when i rated it much lower than i do now i thought it was too puzzley too simple too programmed yet after accepting that it is a puzzle i enjoy it far more i like having an idea of whats next and being able to plan for it and i like working with others to devise the best plan to tackle the problem its pretty good im not a fan of coops but i can stomach this one this is a great game to introduce nongamers to a bit more of a puzzle than a game still the theme and gameplay work well together a nice warmup game to give everyone at the table a win or many losses plays well as a solo game too upgraded super fun quick and easy to learn i enjoy this game more when i play it than when i am thinking about playing it  if this makes any sense i am not always excited about playing this game but when i do i get sucked in and enjoy it a lot work together or die aloneer no everybody die in fact  played it with the kids today the rating might go up a bit after playing with adults although it seems like just another cooperative game to me which i am not a huge fan of nope rating moved downward after another play with the adults this isnt really a game  its a social event really its a puzzle hell you could really play this one by yourself solitaire includes extra roles main course enjoyable 24 player fully coop game with a good level off difficulty i enjoy the cascading outbreaks piece of the game and the different roles really impact how you playalso the way shuffling is broken out is really smart because it separates the epidimecs from each other but are still random and the locations hit are less random just like a real epidemic pandemic was my first coopgame it was a pleasant surprise to play with my cogamers instead of against them pandemics theme is great its fairly easy to explain the game to other players and its a very addictive game the difference between a win and a loss is very small and after each lost game youll want to get in the game again and try to beat the system this time im looking forward to all the expansions ive purchased the first one recently just havent had the chance to try is really enjoy it could eventually see my rating of this going down a tad bit though if replay value starts to decrease ios app this is one of the best secondtier gateway games you know if the relationsfriends thought carcassonne or settlers was fun you bring out pandemic a modern masterpiece of board game design i love this coop game i play mostly with my husband were not good enough for this game to be boring yet games are of appropriate length and we cheer when we think were winning and curse right when the tides turn against us the intensify cards are pure genius and feels thematically perfect as a mechanic the only downside is that each game does feel very samey so its hard to play this multiple times in a row my intro to coops and still tons of fun in my book so many games go right down to the last couple of cards terrific tension 2 3 4 5 cooperativo razo vel parece que fica melhor com a exp on the quicker end of coops i tend to play this multiple times in a night a lot of fun especially as my girlfriend is a doctor we find it very hard to beat at the higher levels but things are well balanced between the two of us with neither of us bossing the game we do argue a lot but split the decisions this game has been received well by everyone who has played it gamers and nongamers its hard which also makes it fun my wife and sister both like this game which is great the game that made me love board games such a classic i ll eventually play the legacy version sometime in the future in the meantime pandemic still is a game i play very often with friends or people than don t really know much about board games and cooperative gameplay guaranteed enjoyment every time  all there played several times not legacy ive only ever played the original pandemic and tbqh ive never really enjoyed myself much its one of those that has felt more like a chore to me i think that first solo experience just cast a shadow over every subsequent playthrough with friends and family  and as much as ive still enjoyed my cooperative plays of pandemic it still just feels like another interchangeable board game i do however still want to pick up the legacy versions that really skyrocketed this ips fame currently in storage  my pops in the us joc cooperativ intens scurt destept ce mai ni se potriveste excellent i guess one of the better coops in theory requires avoiding alpha players and a some restricting of communication in order rock okay my first coop game i mostly followed the direction of the others who were more experienced dont really care for the theme the first proper game i owned excellent game  i recommend this game to anyone  the expansions make it even better one of my favorite coops it scales well and the tension is real the mechanisms are thematic and elegant i might prefer the 2player experience since it is the least chaotic the base game can feel a bit samey after a handful of plays but on the brink really spices things up expansions owned  on the brink still works well as a coop gateway a great gateway game for a multitude of reason into both the hobby and the coop genre coops in general make great gateway games because new players are able to be coached along because of the win or lose altogether mechanic but this game takes the cake this game is easy to teach and learn because the concept is based in our present day and easy for people to grasp and relate to the game setups up easily and provides clear instructions for new players to follow with in mere turns anyone can grasp the game and start making decision for them selves and contributing to the outcome this game also has a relatively short play time which is always a plus when introducing new player to the hobby or gaming in general for nongamers me and my wife being avid coop players do not find this game to be much of a challenge but it is a nice escape from some of the more stress inducing mind bender coops that we play i rate this game so highly simply because of its utility as a gateway game for which it fires on all cylinders also this game is readily available via major shopping chains pandemic was my reintroduction into board gaming i loved the concept of working as a team to save the world from different diseases i enjoy the coop playhowever the more i played the more difficult it got to play with beginners an experienced player with beginning players will often end up tell each player what to do this can take some of the fun out of working as a team to come up with solutions if you are learning this game with others it is a great time if you are looking for a way to reinvigorate the challenge i would recommend picking up one of the many expansions classic game that belongs in everyones collection a fun coop game  wanting to try out the newer legacy version great game thats for both casual and long time gamers fun puzzle moments and a cool unique theme but just as personal taste i dont get drawn back to playing it although i have not yet beaten the game also on the brink expansion played it solo as well as with the family works great easy to learn quick to set up and play and always exciting one of the best games ever made i love this game so far ive played it by myself two player and three player i have the version with the two new roles quarantine specialist and contingency planner i think playing with one role isnt nearly as fun as multiple roles with fewer players game play is always a bit different depending on the roles and strategies they demand but i can see this maybe getting too predictable if you play it a lot 10 plays 4 i kinda like it but its a bit dry for my taste i think ill trade this away at some point played this game with a friend we were convinced we were going to win down to the last cardand then we lost cool gameits rare to find a good coop game the first really succesful cooperative game where you will try to save humanity together by creating the right medicines in time played with the right people this can be a very entertaining activity minus 3 replayability  10  1 great coop very smart game but with 4 it can start to get more difficult especially when someone doesnt wanna work together and wants to do their own thing pandemic remains the best of the true cooperatives ie without a traitor mechanic it does suffer from the tendency to devolve into solitaire but the mechanics are elegant wellbalanced and susceptible to real player skill  lima fighting with betrayal for my favorite game 24 players best 4 rec 1 2 3 cooperative game that is very exciting and very challenging difficulty can be adjusted based off of how hard you want the game to be great game but i can rarely get it to the table  most of my friends dont like cooperative games the virus spreading mechanic is very cool  you can really sense the theme what i like most about pandemic is that it is a really good game to introduce to new gamers edit pandemic is finally getting some plays because my daughter 8 years old is able to grasp the mechanics and play which is really fantastic top 3 coopgames maybe nr 1 what a great game this game hates us we are only ever able to watch the world burn im not real keen on this though it does seem to get a lot of love from my more casual gamer friends i feel like its really more of a solo game played en masse that leads to a single player or a group of players who are more familiar and seasoned telling the rest of the gamers what to do and when to do it it lacks a sense of satisfaction the random nature of the outbreaks makes it a real hit or miss experience for me its not a bad game and its generally really well received its also not a terribly long game which is good but if im choosing myself im not picking this game very often alpha player problem not easy to solve result seems to be highly dependent on the luck of card draw my family is not a big fan so far  i ve seen her twice since 3rd time s a charm now hers  decided to give my copy to my niece next time i see her think she d enjoy this coop didnt expect to enjoy this but it was fun medium coop after playing this game thoroughly i have decided to review it i have played it with several groups of people and everyone settles into the cooperative aspect quite well i won my first game last night with four people and i have to say after about seven losses with that very same group we were thrilled high fives were in order there are few games where as a group high fives are in order and becasue this game is one of them it deserves a 10 my first cooperative game my gateway to legacy games very appropriate for  good game played only once in a company of one experienced player and four rookies while the coops really do not seem to be my cup of tea i can appreciate the design this is a shared project of logistics chain management in which the various player roles are meant to offer some additional optimization exercise it matters who is where and when a quick debriefing after a defeat in a beginner level game revealed the importance of establishing research stations as wormholes around the map but overall i found this a bit too random to be enjoyable as a strategy game as cooperative games go pandemic keeps you more engaged than shadows over camelot as your turn comes back quicker and with 4 action points  a few more options as some have said the board seems too small feels too much like a puzzle but i still want to play especially now with the expansion cooperative   fun but often just seems like one person figuring out the strategy and the others just being following directions un cooperativo que se ha convertido en un b sico de muchas ludotecas es uno de los juegos que mejor partido saca a las diferentes habilidades de cada personaje requiere experiencia as  que seguid el m todo cient fico analizad vuestros errores y utilizadlos para mejorar i like playing it with my wife and she loves it because we work together unlike other games it is very well balanced and tends being tense until the last moment of victoryloss i actually like that you lose often and have to carefully plan each step in my opinion 2 player game is better that 34 player game fun but i feel like standard pandemic was too generic good to learn but probably want return to it great gateway game fun experience although i dont like the knowledge that there are some card configurations that are seemingly unbeatable pandemic is a great cooperative game with a unilaterally acceptable theme the integration of theme to gameplay is a little abstracted though but mechanically very functional the only negative factor about pandemic is the ending whether a win or a loss has an anticlimactic feel the condition for victory being just curing all 4 diseases rather than having to eradicate them usually leaves the world roiling with infection even though the game has been won it feels somehow unsatisfying chose to search for a 1st edition of pandemic purely because i dont like the pompous cover art on the 2nd edition extremely high luck factor mitigated somewhat by roles great game takes a while but it is worth it the set up takes a long time though would recommend highly best w 3 players as cards do not run out quickly intense fun a bit on the meaty side pretty prone to the alpha gamer but after several plays the optimal solution will always prevail with the vote of all players cooperative wow  had to lower my rating a ton after beating pandemic legacy really zero desire to play this ever again honestly its so dull comparatively hmmm really wanted to like this especially with swine fever in the air but really dull not enough choices for my liking  and look we all died now i own it and played 4 times with the same group before the win i like it a lot more you need to have a group wh are committed to the process so that 1 player me doesnt dominate fun stuff how else can you get together with friends to fight off ebola the plague zika and boneitis a this is not the first time ive played pandemic but every time it strikes me as less exciting than i had hoped for there is mostly one sensible solution to take or sometimes two that seem rather equal so then we do that end of the story  best played with random roles do your role well and youll win fun game its a good game and a lot of people tend to like it however it doesnt appeal to me as much as other cooperative games with different themes arkham horror space monster etc but it is very mechanically sound and still a good fun game to play also its not too complex regel this one is growing on me the more i play very tough to beat  a plus for a coop game imho makes every victoy seem hardfought and wellearned re edici n paradox some clever mechanics here can see the hidden cards not working in some groups though a nice different take on most board game in that it is a coop in my gaming group its good fun but i would imagine if there is a dominant person in your group then they might get quite annoying worth a play but not a huge amount of replayability so the game develops according to just your decisions and yet it may be impossible to solve no matter what decisions you take just because of the way the cards are stacked so if i was trying to win i was just wasting my time plus bland unimmersive theme pass id rather let the world die to colorful viruses in form of cubes isa  rated 8 after two plays its a pretty good cooperative game it might suffer a bit without the possibility of traitor but im not sure i like the chain reaction of viruses and the building tension the first game we lost and the second game was won with only one card in the draw pile 1st game  no researcher and the second game  no scientist the researcher and medic seem most valuable followed by the dispatcher then operations manager or whatever and last scientist roles make some interesting combos especially between medic researcher and dispatcher i do have a concern that this could become easy both games were played with the normal deck with 5 epidemics throughout 45 cards 2 more games 4player 1 win and 1 loss the second loss was due to both outbreaks and the red virus running out 1 more round and the researcher wouldve cured the last disease update 2 twoplayer games with the wife she likes it its very good with two just remember not to be too bossy update settled at 7 its funny how differently i view the roles now at first the medic was king and the scientist the weakest clearly after a dozen games or so the big power combo is scientist  researcher however in a twoplayer game the medic is pretty grand in that he can treat diseases every two turns instead of four very interesting game that i believe ive explored quite thoroughly i still have to play it more with my usual group as most plays were twoplayer with my wife accurate count is probably in the upper 20s what can i say that hasnt already been said about how great this game is prone to new gamers or casual gamers having their turns virtually played by others very easy and dulllater games from designer are betterforbidden desert is a way better game this game is really fun although i go for black last my favorite game quite liked this would give a better opinion when we play again it seemed really easy last time i have 2 copies of this both the old and new print with more roles a classic and my true gateway game after catan i only played catan once and have no desire to really play it over and over again but this one i will get many the game that got me back into board games i really really like this game it is a lot of fun and it is my favorite game to introduce new people to gaming with the only problem with it is it becomes a puzzle to be solved instead of a game to play after a while the expansion really helps with this a good game an excelent game actually every one i have played it with wants to play it again it truly deserves its sales figures original engaging and easy to explain excellent gaming for the whole family en casa great coop game event after many plays the game is still hard to beat youl get some easy wins but youl get impossible ones too fun with any number of players the interaction between the players is great everyone trying to bring their point of view great coop game with any number of players only negative is the components are starting to ware after not to many plays imo pandemic is a game of efficiency in which people argue about who does what an epic struggle of man vs cardboard fura hogy annyira sikeres lett a j t k hogy a legacy c mek cs csa is erre  p lt de pont emiatt az alapj t k m r kicsit kev s tov bbra is  tletes er sen kooperat v neh z  de kb 20 legacy k r ut n m r ismert  s ism tl d  is its just not that exciting my friends enjoy this one more than i do so i have to concede to them on occasions interestingly the ones who like it most alpha game the shit out of it and we rarely win a great cooperative game that appears more complex than it really is plays in a good timeframe for what it is great components and theme variable player powers and random virus spread system give it high replayability can be very hard but wed be bored if it was too easy as a bonus it plays great solo solidly fun game that plays well with two three or four players it is alphagamer susceptible though completed on max difficulty with the medic eli dispatcher karen reasercher vivi operation expert nathan sleeved played it many times over and it was probably my first board game that wasnt monopoly or risk etc i still tend to enjoy the game but i only want to play it with new people for the most part picked up season 0 a while ago to try to get back into it but cant seem to find a consistent group that wants to go through it mikael have enjoyed it enough to add it to our collection amy cooperative games are not my favorite genre but this is my favorite of the group it has a completely unique theme and is truly cooperative the game difficulty is well designed with the initial level winnable the majority of the time and the most difficult level nearly impossible to win this game can suffer from a dominant personality though this game could almost certainly get a 10 rating if my nongamer wife likes it and as of aug  she had her first play and enjoyed it pandemic is an excellent 4 player cooperative game it is pretty easy to learn doesnt take too long and it is fun characters add a bit of variability although some are very powerful and others pretty useless have fun saving the world groundbreaking and fun 34p   rating increases to 8 with on the brink expansion pointless to play when theres always a table captain telling everyone what to do a good introductory to cooperative board games played solo 2 hands 2p and 3p its fun easy to learn and set up is fast but game gets repetitive quickly in my opinion looking forward in getting the expansions and the legacy games one of my wifes favorite games it is not a game that i want to play often but every time my wife wants to play it i have fun nice game thats easy to get to the table with novice gamers at home fantastic cooperative game full of theme clever mechanisms and plenty of colourful cubes i like that every character has very distinct special abilities and am very impressed with how well balanced the game is no matter how many people are playing a classic 245 i play it only solo for now and i really enjoy it i give it 9 because of the few games played but i think i will change it to 10 because as i play it more i start to enjoy it more included in box gameid fun cooperative game i would love to try it with on the brink which i heard adds some more variables id also like to see a bit more balancing in the roles some of us felt a little less useful than the others it is a game that i enjoy playing over and over again own in the lab and on the brink expansions coop i was crying for a good coop game for too long pandemic definitely is the cure i feel comfortable to expect that my nongamer friends will promptly like it comes with the on the brink expansion even with pandemic legacy i think being a more interesting game and enjoyable experience i still love pandemic this game has a lot of fun stress in it and as you play there are always multiple options that you want to do at once probably my top cooperative games out there have enjoyed this everytime i have played it each game varies greatly and i have won easily on the easy level but also lost miserably on the same level im bumping this up after playing with the bioterrorist it makes the game not totally obvious even if it does drag the game on longer my wife and i both like this game it brings in people who dont generally like board games and allows people to work together on a common and rather newsworthy opponent great game that will probably never be played again with spirit island in the house this is a good game for 14 if you let everyone play their own hand i cant abide it when someone tries to play everyone elses hand for them best cooperative game i know thrilling struggle with diseases works fine for two players as well as a gateway game for larger number of players quiz s mis expectativas sobre este juego eran demasiado altas a tenor de los comentarios de otros jugadores la verdad me ha decepcionado un poco cumple bien su cometido sencillo r pido y familiar pero demasiado factor suerte en el resultado final  finalmente me deshice de  l no dir  que sea un mal juego pero desde luego no es para m  creo que carece de estrategia emoci n y gracia de verdad que no entiendo su inmerecida fama  i expected more from this game its an easy and fast familiar game but with too much luck factor for my taste i was disappointed  no strategy no emotion no fun boring gameboard i sold it yet to win this one always seem to run out of cards just before victory would love to try again maybe with on the brink added no s  que tiene este juego que me fascin  es tenso intrigante frustrante y cuando sales victorioso sumamente gratificante tal vez esto pasa porque es uno de los primeros juegos que prob  pero cada que alguien dice jugamos pandemic mi respuesta siempre va a ser s  cooperative games with no traitor just dont tickle our fancy ive never had so much fun losing all the time seriously im super competitive and this is kind of like a game of blackjack where the house always gets 20 and wins ties you need skill and a decent amount of luck to win on the hardest difficulty but that makes it all the more awesome when you do win honestly i win about 30 percent of the time on the hardest difficulty and 70 percent of the time on the easiest one great game thats not too complex so you can easily introduce new people into playing along with the rest can cause hectic games where people are shouting what to do next when things start to make a turn for the worse to me thats a testament for how well received it is by my friends benchmark for cooperavite games played it four times never touched since good non competitive game rules slightly complex when i first got this game i played it all the time shortly after though i feel that the game is starting to become overly easy i think i might revisit this game if i get one of the other versions or maybe one of the expansions for it but for right now its a very fun game its perfect for cooperative modes and it would be a good game to pick up gameplay can feel a bit mechanical but the theme and tension are fun i feel like were getting our butts kicked most times we play it but for the most part it has been enjoyable the tension is great and i feel like i must make the best decision possible each turn to have a chance to win this game it can have some of the normal pitfalls associated with coop games but nonetheless i feel it is a good game and look forward to playing it more played 16x at various player counts and its fantastic its really challenging even if we know all the other persons cards but when we won it felt amazing because we were always getting by by the skin of our teeth at least it felt that way love this game specifically love the cooperative concept of the game nice to work together rather than against each other also love how the game is different each time and is not always so easy to win due the the randomness its always just as fun and rewarding to not win played multiple times nice cooperation game good for regular gamers ive tried hard to enjoy this game but it just doesnt click with me it always feels like the deck has more influence on the game than you do additionally this is fundamentally just a solo game and i dont play solo enjoy this game but dont need in my collection defenately not a 3player game in 4 games we did not win a single game maybe with 4 players a chance for more success i really like this game however i dont like the convolutedness of the card passing other than that its an evil game we have won games thought lost early on and lost games in one turn after almost winning all expansions played  times i dont think at this point i would ever play this again but thats due to the sheer volume of play might as well play legacy we had fun with the game it is very difficult and frustrating at time you also have to be ok with the fact that its a multiplayer puzzle that you are all working together to solve pandemic along with dominion and tales of the arabian nights was my very first boardgame purchase after discovering bgg this is one coop game that works really well although i could see how more experienceed players could more or less drive the actions of less experienced players to the extent ofnonparticipation as long as people play as a team then this is a definite winner the theme fits perfectly the rules are simple and the mechanic governing the spread of the various diseases is absolutely fantastic so far won one two player lost one three player currently my coop game of choice willing to trade as its not so popular with my regular opponents excellent game for 2 players difficult but amazing fun actually played this game a lot but before i started tracking plays consistently very fun coop game with good tension throughout could have better components and graphics to amp up the mood but its all serviceable relatively easy to explain and get into gear but as with all coop games its the temper and tone of your crew that will make or break the fun factor 10x10  fun repetitiveness  lack of randomizers hurt my opinion on replay obviously have fallen in love with this one as a new buy girlfriend really likes it too the cooperative angle is interesting havent played too many like that my second favorite cooperative game the design and increasing level of threat help keep everyone engaged from the first infection to the last outbreak my lifetime winloss rate is around 50 is that good a 7 if we cant beat it coop first edition including on the brink i thought this was a keeper the first few times because it seemed to be the ideal gateway game for my family i now think coop games are better played among more hardened gamers both because its too easy for one person to boss everyone around in a gamernongamers situation and because nongamers can find the savage punishment were all going to die nature of a coop a real downer among gamers this is way better my most enjoyable games of pandemic have come when all players are autonomous planners card information is not completely shared and a kind of brains trust emerges but having said that i am a little concerned that in a game where player interests are perfectly aligned it seems irrational not to be just laying our cards down to show each other right away this is the game that got me into playing modern boardgames i had no concept that boardgames could be cooperative before this if you want to get someone into the hobby this is where you start addictive let me start by saying that pandemic might be best quality of manufacturing i have seen in a game the boards and cards are nice heavy stock and the print job was nicely done i am not one to usually ooze about board quality but i genuinely appreciate this one that being said pandemic is not a game that is intended to be played every week its a nice quick game to play when youre feeling really cooperative and have an hour between other games it does this very well i am very happy to have it in my collection even if it took me quite a while to get to the table   traded for die macher all expansions this is fun my wife and i have played this a few times we quite enjoy coop games and this is one of the best if not the best weve played a fantastic game but i tend to like cooperative games in general so your mileage may vary is difficult but has a good amount of tension in the card flips and its fun to run around and try to stop the spread of the diseases im a fan of this one an interesting coop game very different theme quick play and a fun challenge for a group of players or solo at the heroic level really enjoy the cooperative dynamic the entire team wins or loses the different roles and actions add a nice mix standard gateway coop game basically the same as flash point but you win or lose based on the city draws plays 15 definitely a modern classic with a system that has inspired countless game since its release withe its point system and cooperative play trying to overcome the constant spread of diseases unfortunately the game does have the opportunity for a quarterbacking problem as and as innovative as the action system was its definitely been refined in other games since good game to play to appreciate what it did for the hobby but no longer the game i go for to scratch that cooperative itch this is an awesome game the family loves it cooperative and hard to win excellent cooperative game an easytolearn coop game with simple but wellthemed mechanics that requires wellthought strategy and solid team work bought january  used copy fun moments and fantastic game mechanics but always ends with a hohum as you can easily tell a few turns out if you will win or lose enjoyed this game with the familybut now will see action only a few times a year easy to play cooperative game different strategies to win nice wooden game components simple but effective gameboard the gateway game of choice when playing with 4 people due to the fact that it is 1 completely different than everything else 2 coop so nongamers are not worried about getting crushed by gracie and i 3 plays under an hour 4 only confusing because it is so different after getting a round in people realize just how simple the basic ideas are this gets a lower ranking though because it just gets repetitive due to its coop nature thank goodness for the expansion i find only the hardest difficulty to be challenging and i suspect it is largely a matter of luck whether you will win i wonder if anyone has ever done a monte carlo analysis as i expect a certain percentage of card combinations cannot be won great game well balanced cooperative game with an adjustable difficulty level making it playable by both casual and serious gamers although the replayability may be limited for the latter  pandemia al l mite super  good game but can be difficult to find partners to play great coop game thanks heresince for such an awesome gift  it is so fun to see the dread on my daughters face as the tension of the game mounts with every outbreak played a couple times more and still cant get too excited its a good short coop game but suffers from serious solution problems groupthink can be a bad thing and this shows it full force the game is fun but the path is so deterministic i wanted to bump up the rating since the last game we narrowly won was exciting but i cant help but think that i would want the opposite had we lost i love this  the mechanics of it are so simple got stuffed for the first time at the weekend  we werent playing with the medic and had the operations specialist who is about as useful as a rubber chicken not a huge fan of cooperative games but i am willing to play this from time to time and have enjoyed the app the random setup can leave you with a basically impossible game but this feels quite rare a great staple in any collection still fun to play even though i feel like i have the game relatively figured out also enjoy the second edition and glad that we upgraded from firstedition as good as it can be perfection the gold standard in coop games great theme art is a little bland this game was the first game that makes me addicted to board games this is a very ehh game for me granted i have only played with 4 epidemic cards so maybe if i add more it will liven up the game for me pandemic seems to hang around because there is enough challenge that you could fail and there is learning that can happen as to how to play the game while you play the game a coop as a coop should be looking forward to the expansion though  classic survival cooperative game players vs the board a very fun game but i dislike grim realistic themes rocio 33 amazon  i m not a fan of cooperative games and now i know every time i ve played someone decides what everyone should be doing and i m just sitting there going through the motions awful game update  forced to play a few more times tried to mitigate the one person controlling things and it was a bit better still not a great fan but will play when others really want to good but there are better coops out there the expansion is necessary to keep this one interesting played once many years ago didnt like it watch table top video of people enjoying themselves playing it didnt like it there is something about this game that just hits me square in the dont likes much like eating calamari rating 4 and dont really expect i will ever play again aug  update i still dont get the appeal basically the alpha gamer takes control and it just seems like a puzzle solver than a game or a computer game as a board game would rather play the simpler forbidden island and let the kids take control rating  dec  update pub meeple ranking engine dec  rating  theme and mechanic work really well this is a game that encourages cooperation and definitely ramps up the stress levels as you progress through it great game very popular with both gamers and nongamers nothing here to dislike plays well scales well and game length is just about right theme proving very popular with both gamers and nongamers simple to teach this has elevated the coop genre of gaming to a new and higher level and will taking some matching in the future an exceptional game on many levels highly enjoyable coop game difficult to beat but can suffer from the bossy gamer we usually play with full open cards but we may start moving away from that cooperative tr s bon jeu jouer de pr f rence sans la chercheuse qui simplifie trop les parties et rend les autres r les donc joueurs beaucoup moins importants  impressed by this game i played this game roughly 67 yrs ago simple mechanics but lots of strategic planning starts off a little slow at first but gets more intense near the end only downside is that we tend to play the backtrack movesactions like a rewind feature so that we can get optimal play newer players may tend to do that but overall great game a keeper high rating due to cooperative playbig innovationbut after some plays experienced players will find that there is no depth in strategiesthere are auto moves that lead to victory thus excitement wont last long a nice break between more competitive and interesting games excellent family game but prone to alpha player syndrome have digital version as well classic not much to be said outside the fact that its fun and you should play it like new with bonus petri dishes i dont love cooperative strategy games where everyone is working toward one sole objective its too easy for one person to run the show i can get bossy id like it if everyone had personal objectives in addition to team object or some similar mechanic most of the folks that i played with though really liked the game pp best coop game ive ever played it required a lot of collaboration with other played in order to have a successful run with varying difficulty settings its always a challenge no matter your skill level one of my all time favorite games seamless cooperative play i personally have never had a struggle with the alpha player complex instead every game ive played has been a perfect blend of cooperation and individualism definitely cooperative games are not for me i tried with this but leading effect is too sharp thought really good on the first couple of playthroughs but rapidly gets easy and a little limited quick and fairly light cooperative game soloable i usually like games that are a bit heavier and more competitive but i love this game if someone suggests this i never turn it down fun cooperative game with interesting plague mechanic pieces are simple bowling pin pawns and infection cubes but made out of wood and nicely painted you can play at several difficulty levels but any above introductory are brutally difficult this becomes frustrating when you hit 2 epidemics in the first two rounds of the game causing several outbreaks also be sure to watch out for the alpha gamer who may just tell other players what to do for this playing with your hand concealed may be necessary most groups can get along well enough so that eveeryone can contribute to the strategy of curing diseases the first time i played this i hated it one of the guys was a control freak and pretty much told everybody else what to do luckily i was willing to give this another chance and i was able to see how much fun it could be its nice that all of the cooperative games are very different in feel and mechanics dont get me wrong pandemic is very fun but there are a few things not to like and its not as deep as i want in a meaty board game on the plus side it is perhaps the most perfect holiday game ive come across lately dont play while stoned seriously sleeves  wooden box terrific coop game simple rules and very thematic good choice for new gamers and the epidemic mechanic that drives the whole game is brilliantly elegant only downside is lack of long term strategic complexity but very fun to play nonetheless i love this coop game its really challenging and fun plays well with 2 3 or 4 players this is a must buy the concept hooks me more than just about any other game and the mechanics are really well thought out a good cooperative game which i genuinely typically enjoy quite a bit i have very little to complain about with this game i just dont play it super often       the game feels stale after a few times playing it not a bad game overall and never regret playing it but have other games i would rather play sara superspel quickly became our dev teams favourite coop boardgame high quality print and packaging design production in a very welldesigned box my eradication challenge variant httpwwwboardgamegeekcomthread good coop but after a few plays i started to lose interest the decisions are pretty straightforward and once you have a good strategy you just go through the motions and hope for the best do not expect a cake walk with this one with only one victory in 3 plays and that was with the easy setting of only 4 epidemics this game challenges you and up to 3 friends to save the world from an assortment of nasty viruses communication and teamwork are the most important things to use that and the medic role if you want to get anywhere near taking care of the virus outbreaks around the world excellent value in cooperative gaming simple or complex game with many variants with expansions a must have if you like cooperative games this one is a must have played multiple times currently looking for expansions purchased new in shrink but likely a highquality inauthentic version if i had to name a game or a few games that are almost essential gateways into the hobby then pandemic would be number one the best game mechanism that ive ever played hard going at times but so so rewarding when you beat it and ive never met anyone who hasnt played it and not wanted another go fun but gets old after a while els  j t k ketten ez egy k nny tett verzi  volt el g j l r rezt nk milyen taktik t k vess nk az els  pillanatt l fogva az orvos  s a mikrobiol gus

the games that i enjoy the most hands down at the moment my favorite coup game very easy to learn but very chalanging to master have lot of fun when playing during covid19 fun coop though after a number of games to learn the strategy the eventual win or loss sometimes has as much to do with the roles selected and order of the cards drawn as anything x sort of weak once youve beaten the game a few times in a row fully cooperative board games are sort of dull for me i think the game is clever but loses a lot in ability to play it again and again danishnorwegian edition from  still a firm favourite after probably  plays before i started recording plays the challenge is different each time depending on how many players are playing and what roles we pick up the thing i most like about pandemic is that you need to be thinking strategically from almost the first move you cant afford to waste a move or you run out of cards or run out of outbreak cubes or have too many outbreaks there are just too many way to fail to save humanity  my wifes favorite we really enjoy this one especially with the in the lab expansion the game which brings me to this hobby beside dead of winter 16 oct 14  love this game on the brink is a must expansion but this is a fantastic solo game i play two player by myself often and love it its great to set yourself challenges and see if you can beat it also kids aged around 10 and up love playing this one too easy to set up and play highly recommend awesome game puzzle like and very challenging each game is different great cooperative game nice coop game im surprised at how fun this is given my preference for competitive gaming and general dislike of random elements z  great cooperative game but once everyone knows the skills of the different positions it becomes too much of a groupthink oriented game ein paar mal gespielt zu hoher gl cksanteil seems like a good game i played on the introductory level so everything seemed beyond manageable for a 4player game including a scientist and operations expert we even managed to cure blue before any cities were infected with it i would definitely like to try it again with a higher difficulty level great game and it is a coop that doesnt end up with one person playing everyones turn it is very common to lose in this game so dont fret problem with this game is that you cant play it with experienced and nonexperienced players the experienced players will quickly tend to start controlling the game and tend to tell the others what to do the game was a fairly fun i think its a pretty solid coop game unlike some people i wouldnt recommend this as a first coop game the rules arent hard but its not that easy a game for the group to win the deck can be stacked against you this game didnt really come alive for me until i tried pandemic legacy that was a hell of a lot of fun although for a legacy coop i think you really need some very good players who can think strategically tactically and who can change their way of doing things quickly if needed its not for the faint of heart or faint of mind strategic coop with many roles one of my favs would recommend to anyone interested in the coop genre if you buy it youre going to need to figure out a way to store the disease cubes in the box az els  modernebb j t kunk a kezdetekt l vel nk van  s m g mindig nem unjuk a koop j t kok koron zatlan kir lya n lunk this is a great coop game another that is easy to teach and very challenging can suffer from game commander syndrome but if you dont take it too seriously this game is tons of fun not a deep game but a great cooperative experience fun game to play has different complexities depending on the number of players and epidemics chosen really well designed and fun each time it is played great coop even better with expansions excellent with family and solo with gamers not so much three games on easy settings  lost two this is not an easy game but its fun might upgrade score later the little summary blurb for each numerical rating is kind of brutal i personally have little interest in playing it but i absolutely acknowledge it is an excellent game its a 9 or 10 game but the best i can say is will play if in the mood ps i am virtually never in the mood for it interesting mechanics mi primer cooperativo 100 divertido pero no me enganch  7 partidas i treat this game as a solo game it is just a puzzle to solve and due to the commitment it takes i typically only set this puzzle up on my phone ok coop game didnt care for the theme and it sucks because one person on the time easily carries this game is great for noobs because it is cooperative and easy to understand mostly played by two players even a game with 4 epidemic cards is not easy to win with

challenging team spirit is essential to beat the diseases every game is different but if you find a lack of surprise theyre plenty of expansions i cant play without the lab anymore if youre planning to play with unexperienced board game players maybe starting with forbidden island will be easier than pandemic very fun cooperative game that has tremendous tension and an excellent game mechanic to ratchet that tension up perfect visuals to demonstrate the theme my first cooperative game i found it very clever with brilliant simple game mechanics great solo play infection deck mechanics reshuffling back after each epidemic card is so clever  it truly makes the diseases viruses spread as in real life games played on pc application 103 august  very good cooperative game that plays quickly and is winnable without being too easy played app and in person also playing legacy now too easy to quarterback muy adictivo este juego jugamos 3 partidas seguidas porque el propio juego nos ganaba a la 3  vencimos nosotros al juego y salvamos el planeta this is a tense cooperative game the higher the iq of your group the more likely that you will win it is a real test of risk management versus the odds i won thi game at the toughest level jogo cooperativo puro fant stico acho que pode ser a porta de entrada perfeita para novos jogadores i like it its fast to play easy to teach and a bit different from all the other coops the theme is also spot on and refreshing 23 games are solo games 19 solo games were played when i was in hospital for a week successfully used as team building exercise for each 3 teams of 3  one of them even went out and bought the game  have been incorporating bits of state of emergency from about play 73 24 players  beautiful components smooth gameplay a true classic  ive refused to play pandemic which is enough for the rating to drop to a 7  7  6 further degradation of the rating due to fact that this game heavily suffers from the typical coop syndrome this is the one dominating player bossing round in the table telling people what they must do on their turn by reading this you triggered an epidemic good job up there for my favorite coop its always close and tense if youve never played its a fantastic experience esploristoj batalas konta  mondskala pandemio bela materialo simplaj mekanismoj unu el la plej klasikaj ekzemploj de ludosistemo kies celo estas kunlaborado la temo estas tre originala presak  unika bonega familioludo coop games are not my favorite this one is ok but it still boils down to a group of people doing what the defactoleader tells them to do that being said the game mechanics which spread the virusesdiseases around the globe are rather interesting i wont say its not a good game but im not interested in playing on a regular basis small doses are appreciated great game fun with 4 but also great with 2 players ovp great game i love this game and my wife likes it a lot too it is easy to get immersed in the theme making for a very fun game the ability to adjust the difficulty makes it a great game for any player count a definite winner ive only played solo so far using two characters it played okay but i really need to play with another coop games without any real cooperation just feel too abstract to me hopefully my rating will increase as play with other actual humansedit played with my wife and it was certainly better but im not totally sold on it yet need more plays i enjoy coop games and this is the game that really introduced them to me a good fun difficult game gra great game its a very good intro to coop board gaming i don t love giving 10 s but my 8 yo loves playing this with me and always ends up being the game we pack when we go on vacation expansion  gameid still dont own pandemic base but so many games played on celine and benjamins copies my first real coop love it very much  on the brink  in the lab number of plays more like 20 this game is boring for me  but maybe when i play this with more than 2 players i will change my mind cooperative to save the world game great gateway games if someone are into cooperation games great puzzlecoop game i think this game is slightly overrated one of the best cooperative games available simple enough to play with most people and difficult enough especially on higher settings to keep trying this is a game we come back to time and again which is a good sign never get tired of pandemic six players pandemic not recommended understood why four players maximum board will eat you alive with six p awesome 2 player coopertive game wife loves it intro 21 wins loss normal 32 wins loss heroic 23 wins loss this game got my girlfriend into gaming and its the first game we really enjoyed together i bought it instantly after our first play and from there we played it a lot eventually we burnt out on it and i dont know how much we would ever play this in the future pandemic legacy is the only way we play pandemic now this is the only coop game i like but that isnt exactly saying much more damning with faint praise than an actual compliment but its fun and mercifully quick great fun easy to learn great game with spot on difficulty for 4 players pandemic is decent but im not as thrilled about it as others forbidden dessert is a coop i find moves quicker and has more tension my favorite cooperative boardgame to date i never tire of playing this although it really needs 3 or 4 characters to excel sleeved i had heard much about his gamne and taht it was fun i recievd it for a birthday present thanks bennet i feel it is more of a filler game than something substaial but as such it is an intresting filler in that it is coop the success rate we have had with itat time of typing seems very well  entry note 9 unlikely to increase the note as it is a very good cooperative but on the other hand it is just a cooperative interesting game very nice got our butts kicked in two plays so far great cooperative strategy game only hitch is one person who knows the game tends to dominate need house rules to minimize that greek edition a great cooperative experience it is essential to avoid that one player dominates and decides what everybody should do the experience is ruined if not play with hidden hands allow for suggestions of other players but leave the final decision of action to the active player the game is quite unforgiving and really hard it mostly comes down to how the two decks are stacked but who cares as long as the game is such fun loved this game most people in my circle prefer forbidden island somehow this game fails to induce the fervor other games do in my group wifedaughter we play serious games like agricolapr less serious like carc ttr and i thought being able to play with each other rather than against would increase fun and replayability after 45 games this is still jsut a tad over meh will give it a few more tries though sold during the purge of early  it didnt get played much over the past 18 months and after getting a digital copy it didnt make sense to keep fun game doesnt get played a ton anymore because there are better games out there kind of a boring game no way to strategize considering that the characters are selected at random this makes the game too chaotic rather than challenging dont think that it works well with a set amount of people but rather only with having the scientist and the medic at least in play this is a design flaw very tense game clever and elegant owned by a friend home with nic and caela and decided to play a new game this time it was pandemic after having played many games of forbidden island i can see many comparisons but i like this one better seems to have more decisions and more strategy   upgrading this to a 90 after including the expansions good but not great i guess the restrictions on card trading between players got onto me it throws a monkey wrench on the whole dynamic of the game anyway forbidden desert by the same author totally replaced pandemic for me edit my children love this game so i end up playing it a lot really like this game nice components nice play time some tense moments and good theme not as popular in group now but still liked 24 players played at my meetup  with joanne played a couple of times  huge alpha dog issues with this one so i got rid of it                                   love playing this game with my wife a staple for any board game collection fun  different every game a good gateway game to start introducing your friends to more complex games great with family  friends  everyone works together as a team against the game which i really enjoy coop action for a change i like it a lot specially because it is hard finally got my hands on this one through a math trade everyone seems to enjoy it on the brink has added a lot to this one gateway drug game i thought i didnt like coop games before i tried pandemic but this is pretty good its basically a puzzle that everyone tries to solve together and somehow it worked for me even though i didnt think it would pretty good coop game not easy to win depends on difficulty level of play which is part of the charm for this game i was very skeptical of this game going in because of disappointing experiences with cooperative games in the past and the first play didnt really do much for me but ive since had a chance to play it a few times and i must say that its really growing on me im considering buying a copy now so i can keep playing it more im not quite sure what it is about pandemic that i enjoy but i do know that i keep thinking about the game and revisiting it in my head so its probably worth picking up its so very quick and packs a lot into a short amount of time and its so very brutal and difficult that it makes you want to try again and again the mechanics of the epidemics and intensifying just seem to work so well together that it really achieves the simplicity yet depth that i look for in games received as gift christmas  cooperative cube management has never been this fun lightweight rules heavy on strategy and somewhat determined by luck pandemic is a quick exercise in threat management and teamwork the first cooperative boardgame ive played it definitely takes some getting used to having to negotiate your moves with other players i prefer competitive games but pandemic isnt bad best four player one side game will suggest to play sleeved by patron a very clever game that plays quickly yet offers relatively deep gameplay the tension in this game consistently ratchets up in a manner that provides a great narrative and story arc to the game the rules are easy to grasp and the theme is compelling which makes pandemic accessible to a wide audience there are very few downsides to this game that i can see at the moment perhaps with repeated play this will become somewhat tired but there are many combinations of roles to play each combination providing a different experience requiring changes in approach tactics and strategy i have felt that as i play more i have gotten better at the game which suggests that this is a game of some skill that can be developed as one discovers how the game reacts and the uses of the various roles highly recommended review based on approximately 15 plays note finally beat heroic level in 2player with medic and researcher  a very powerful combination with a different combination especially excluding the medic in 2player heroic level will chew you up and spit you out good fun goodlooking game with a clean and clever game design felt like it got old quick though maybe if it was a zombie outbreak instead  free ive played this game so much that its lost a bit of its luster for me but it is still a game i recommend to everyone lots of fun and replayability especially with the expansion deft cooperative play steadily mounting tension a challenging but fair game arc tons of variety in roles and a potent and unfortunately timely theme make this a modern classic this is a great cooperative game that is extremely wellbalanced and a lot of fun to play unfortunately forbidden island does everything just as well and plays in a shorter amount of time very good coop the mechanisms are well designed even two players can have lots of fun 4 players lost to flood great coop game i wish this game would come with miniatures for the roles instead of wooden pawns it may add an atmosphere to the game we havent figured it out yet right now it appears that once we get a decent strategy down it comes down to the card draws well try it again but wont head out to buy it cooperative game on a viral apocalypse how can you not love it 25 i enjoy a good game of pandemic unpopular opinion time though after a few games it seems to loose quite a lot of pazaz also there can often feel like obviously best moves which take the fun and drama down and new players can often get easily railroaded and taken over by the group still a great game though great theme great mechanics great game good cooperative game its hard to win but fun to play awesome frustrating and awesome have i already said that some games are challenging but even losing is fun get a real sense of panic playing this game modern classic one of the best entrylevel cooperative games out there play some games of this version before you challenge the legacy version dont really know why its considered so good luck is so high and players decisions so few and alpha player is still here july 28   i was introduced to this last week and in one session i played four games of it i was pleasantly surprised to find the game is fun requires a fair bit of thought and is not easy for the players to win its quick play time makes it a clear winner i must buy this 910 january 15   after eight plays i finally experienced a win it was close we were down to our last turn of drawing cards into our hands so the time limit was just about to kill us it was a threeplayer game and we had done quite well keeping outbreaks from happening with any great frequency wed just barely pushed the infection rate to 4 with the medic researcher and scientist we barely beat the clock i find pandemic continues to be tense and interesting now that my girlfriend has experienced its fun and is asking to play it i expect it to hit the table a lot more often no change in rating 910 this is a great team game that is difficult but never feels impossible i like the coop but have never played it on any level higher than beginner good quick coop game danger that one bully player runs the show from an auction arrive here on  first play finally on  location a2 i finally got a chance to play this i only played solitaire but i can see now why its so popular as a solitaire game i like the dice version better so rather than collect all the expansions to this one im going to eventually cull it from my collection and just be happy with the cure this is fun at first but gets stale rather quickly once you figure out the strategy it feels like mostly luck also there is usually one player that understands the strategy better than the rest this player will often take command of other peoples meeples ultimately it feels more like solving a puzzle than an actual game this is probably great for a family with younger children the perfect gateway game intensity is the appeal here cooperative and overwhelming nature of the game are its big pluses best with the itl expansion some games are just impossible to win but thats okay with me from my secret santa  thanks d pure coop makes it rather a candidate for a oneplayergame but always a nice choice when playing with nongamers or people who cant lose playing it with gamers usually gives long discussions about best next moves and different strategies this is a wonderfully challenging  exciting cooperative game i was surprised at how much easier the 4epidemic version is i gotta admit i dont get what all the fuss is about this one didnt really go over very well great game but its expansions are much better every one against the board game i never would have thought the board game would have won great game buy boutique imaginaire cad 21 f vrier  save the world together surprised by how much narrative draws players in everyone wins or everyone loses its boring one of those games everyone should own really looking forward to seeing how it plays win the lab i like pandemic but im surprised when others speak of their great successes with it as a gateway game it seems most of my friends  family dont see the point of a game in which they dont get to compete with each other update 10 years later raising my rating to an 8 the game is excellent on ipad and is so fundamentally sound in theme and mechanics that my daughters started grasping it from age 4 you damn yellow cubes and your world conquering ways 1pintro 2 roles  0w 2l 2pintro 2 roles  1w 2l 2pnormal 2 roles  2w 1l

right from the beginning bar really high in this genre by using clever mechanisms for changing pace between good bad and ugly situation on the board it still gives player filling that nothing is lost until the end instead of just going downhill from one point it is more like roller coaster all the time more often than not youll be in situation to say we needed just one more turn thats all different roles eventepidemiccity cards almost ask you to push your luck to the very limit in combination with smart tactic decisions excellent game   for me it is ultimate solo experience fantastic game my personal number 1 and one of the rare games i simply refuse to play cooperatively its just a personal preference for me it feels like a puzzle i want to solve alone it takes me between  minutes with setup to play full game controlling 3 or 4 characters with 6 pandemic cards which is additional plus evil cooperative game that i am horrible at but love in storage one of my goto games we play with the on the brink expansion tricky unusual in that its a cooperative game i guess its like a puzzle youre working to help solve you all win or lose together usually lose  its tricky dont play it with a mate who is a controlfreak  let everyone have their say on what to do pandemic was the first cooperative game after the venerable lord of the rings by reiner knizia and when i first played there was some unexplicable click between me and the design it took me a few years and horrendous encounters with other coops to realise what the reason for this strange alchemy was the fact that all actions you do as player isucceedi with utmost certainty the game obviously throws quite a lot of random shit at you but players are always sure about what they are doing this has since become an absolute necessity for me to like a coop and so pandemic has stayed with me throughout the years that said it took me a while to learn how to play to win and when i finally did something of the magic vanished making the game harder would be tantamout to merely optimising the various semistrategical paths built into the combination of various roles while not easy it amounts to working out the solution to a puzzle rather than creatively gaming oneself out of a tight spot for this reason ive decided to lower the rate ive given it all those years ago perhaps that with the expansions especially the bioterrorist one which endows the spread of diseases with actual intelligence we hope the actual game can be redeemed the prototypical cooperative game different roles work together to cure all the diseases in the world the plays are basically playing against the board and racing against the clock to get diseases cured by running around the board removing cubes from cities and building research stations to eventually find a cure etc the game can definitely snowball on you as you draw more and more bad cards i think this game is best played where you cant share information from your hand with other players like shadows over camelot you have to speak vaguely otherwise youll get prone to planning moves way ahead of time and getting analysis paralysis the worst problem is definitely quarterbacking though if you have played it before and others havent make sure you really tone back the telling people what to do its helpful to give hints but not to straight up plan peoples moves i like this game its definitely quality but its not my favorite or even my favorite coop id recommend playing it though coop more complicated version of forbidden island this is the old version that is incompatible with the expansions requires rebuy of components to match up a great introduction to cooperative gaming when setting up the game you can change the difficulty by adding more or fewer epidemic cards might resemble current events too much for some players blegh played it twice dont see the fun of it at all felt like an assignment for school which i had to do with 3 classmates i didnt know who likes that bioterrorist some problem with out expansion but with it great cooperation game you just dont feel the threat an excellent cooperative that doesnt feel like the more traditional games of this genre notably lotr and shadows over camelot because of the swift pace and less need for players to confer tidy simple but effective mechanics keep the disease cubes spreading and means that players cant afford to stagnate surprisingly tense stuff too as you reach the final stages it looks like the expansion will help to customise this a dozen different ways for all levels of difficulty and enjoyment further thoughts lacking in longevity it would seem weve done all we can with the game and it looks like we might be going back to shadows over camelot

the game for average level but hero mode is fantastic and extremely difficult felt repetitive after several games rating for family play pro  excellent game implementation components  wise theme with good implementation  high tension during the whole game cons  a lot of cases where there is only one right move result can be played from time to time as it often happens with cooperative games when playing pandemic those who know how the game works aim to tell those who don t what they have to do thus reducing the latters  playing to just a handful of soulless and unsatisfying turns whose only end is to maximize their moves this way though the newcomers feel useless all the time do almost nothing and understand even less thus failing to enjoy the game as far as cooperatives go there are many better games than pandemic whose theme though is undoubtedly its weakest point as well very interesting concept liked that it was cooperative which is very unusual seems really hard to win though but a creative concept that captures the theme great game the mechanics are very solid and clear game quality is great the coop aspect works well if given to some quarterbacking sometimes keeps you constantly on edge about what comes next and can be frustrating when you are doing everything well and suddenly get screwed over by a card but well so is life sometimes x may  85 great solitaire gamepuzzle also good with several players i dont like playing with people that arent interested but they are just cubes dec  8 great game but the more i play it the more i see a puzzle and not a themed adventure but thats just me this is my first cooperative game my wife and i both love it when she is not around i am still able to play it solo a must own in my opinion propably one of the few coop games i enjoy very smooth play with every player playing a great part in defeating the game keeps the tension from stat to finish the rules are simple concise and clear with few if any ambiguities game play is fluid and there is considerable interaction between the players with the right group there is one way to win and there are 3 ways to lose the game and each of the 3 seems to occur with roughly equal frequency which means that players must pay attention to three different countdowns its agreeably hard to beat and the level of difficulty is easily adjusted to the level of experience of the players the mechanics  in particular the mechanism for intensifying threat  are familiar from forbidden island but better implemented with a cascade mechanism that adds a little piquancy to the game the game is vulnerable to the alpha gamer and there are no individual goals that might have mitigated that in the groups ive played with this has not been an issue so it may be more theoretical than real while the cards and the jewellike viruses are excellent im less keen on the bland anonymous pawns some of whose colours are difficult to distinguish in low light ive replaced mine with small figurines that make it easier for players to find their avatar easily on the board i would recommend this game without reservation to anyone new to boardgames only played once but it suffered from one player telling others what to do always in demand the best cooperative game i have played highly recommended like most coop games this usually turns into a game of group think which i dont enjoy otherwise an enjoyable casual game i just love the whole idea of being at the right place at the right time thanks to the important hand over information action you have to be with the right person at the right place at the right time what makes this game a beautiful coop the dynamics that are created between the players due to the rolecards is just superb and the shuffling of the discarded infections and putting them on top again after an epidemic deserves the nobel price for game mechanics one of the better cooperative games love the puzzle aspect my most played game time spent love this game and love teaching it to new players 25   muutaman kerran pelattu peli suomiversio cant go wrong with pandemic as i mature in my game playing it gets to the table less and less  but i still love it my first boardgame purchase as i got back into the hobby i enjoy playing this game but it was not for my group since they are too competitive i tried to get my wife into it but couldnt it would probably be a good solo game but isnt worth the setup when i can play games online if i want to d105 116 great game  everyone likes cooperative and can be very tough to win on harder settings jeu de coop ration  jeu de d placements a big favorite of my wife plays great with 24 players were doing well with 5 epedemics but havent tried 6 yet after playing a few games with open cards we decided to try cards in hand and it works much better we talk about what cures each player is aiming for and where we could meet up to exchange cards otherwise we each take our turns without overanalyzing each others cards this not only speeds up the game but makes it more realistic   bumped rating from 8 to 9 pandemic with expansion is now the goto game for my wife and me played 20 times over christmas even my wife enjoys it outstanding game one drawback only it could generate the personification of quarterback player so mind it if you have someone like that in your family aside from this you should throw away all the risks clues monopoly scrabble and the like and replace with pandemic my  secret santa gift santa gave me this along with the expansion  pandemic on the brink this is a good game i like it buy wifey not she doesnt like coop games she would prefer beat me rather than cooperate with me hahaha p had several people advise me that i would like this game i did like the different roles and also the fact that you worked together based on those roles didnt think too much of the subject material when it was explained to me but turned out to be a very fun game on the brink fantastic brutal tension 1 win at the last possible moment sharing knowledge is hardand its key 37 gigamesh barcelona pandemic is a fun cooperative game that my wife an i enjoy playing we were looking for a game that we could play together without wanting to kill each other at the end this was the perfect game for that i very much enjoy playing this game really enjoy playing pandemic fun coop game great fun im 95 sure this is the second edition cards have a texture them as opposed to glossy for the first edition not sure how else to tell them apart family strategy complexity 243 player 25 best 4 i played this recently it was surprisingly fresh and played quickly x interesting and tightly designed cooperative too many plays in a short period and it can to feel a bit samey and it seems like certain role combos make the game much easier than others but all in all a good choice for breaking out every few months pandemic is an awesome game especially if youre trying to get people into boardgames one change we made is cards all face up and no talking whatsoever it makes it so much more interesting trying to predict what your teammates are doing based on their cards not a big fan of coop games and i dont like the theme a game to play with my family as they do not tolerate a longer and more complicated titles well great coop game won barely on easy level i wonder how hard will play out played solo with 5 epidemic cards and my butt was handed to me wife and i played the hell out of this we got really good at it time to get the expansion because it stopped regularly beating us cooperative games with the spouse save relationships some competitive games can get a little vicious likes brittany ben benren arion christa leah great coop game every game is different and a proper challenge to win have to get more plays in but its a pretty fun cooperative allows for a lot of replay and its been pretty tough so far its amazing how fast things can go bad on you just when you think you are doing well is prone to quarterbacking depending on the group i enjoyed is as a solo game too hard at first but gets easier after a few plays can be played solo one of my secret santa gifts from christmas  is this wonderful coop thanks secret santa its reached the table a ton in  and everyone loves it the most memorable games are the ones where sadly when nearing a win that one awful souldraining city comes up in the deck leading to a chain reaction of outbreaks so worth it though addictive plays great solo as well 2 plays prior to logging many plays on app pandemic is a hard game to rate i dont enjoy playing the base game very much anymore but ive really loved playing it in the past and the legacy games its spawned have been among my favorites jadore pas besoin dextensions tout est l  un jeu coop ratif et difficile comme je les aime originally saw this game played on wil wheatons webseries table top and it looked like a lot of fun it is have played only 2player and 4player but the more people you have the more fun it is game has great mechanics unfortunately if you dont want to lose by drawing out in a 4player game you need to have all 6 epidemic cards in or you will most likely run out of cards before you can win its really different to play a game where everyone works together instead of against each other and even though the game usually beats us we still have a lot of fun losing classic pandemic feels way too light for its own good i dont really like the game that much though i dont run away from it either bought at outpost antwerp initial impression 6 a fun and interesting cooperative game that is at heart a sequential action puzzle i think it would work best if players minimized table talk which is actually a fairly major drawback in a cooperative game which should encourage interaction it needs to be played on the harder settings as few epidemic cards lead to a game that seems to have no possibility of failure hence no feeling of accomplishment easy to learn and play but i find it not very strategic and this is what keeps me from playing it more incl exp  auf messers schneide  im labor finally played that game i heard so much good opinions about i expected something totally different its pretty light and i didnt find it a very engaging experience maybe its just me but once you finally win you first game the edge goes also as a coop game there is very little if any individual decisions 234 on the brink excellent cooperative game and a must have in any collection another fab game tension all the way and great for any number of players love playing this one with two so works perfectly for me and my wife i love pandemic i know coops are not for everyone but my wife and i have wrung immense joy out of this game few games create tension like pandemic does you can avoid the quarter backing issue with the right group and a little bit of vigilance it remains challenging after repeated plays and the expansions add complexity once you are ready for them i like this game but the deliberation can be excruciating sometimes if youre not all on the same page  the almost perfect coop game great love it id imagined a game like this after reading stephen kings the stand back in the day cant wait a must buy update sought out on the brink expansion first edition for this while it was still available clever system though a bit too samey because of the limited roles and generic virus behavior the expansion helps with that but really it should have had more variability out of the gate medium players boring dry and lame great game that with many repeated plays got a bit samey played we played this one with lasse one night in germany and i bought my copy off of craigslist i keep toting this one around and it seems like no one ever wants to play it ive been wanting to bust it out for awhile though edit played a couple times with ariane and then again with james and brooke its a pretty solid game id be interested in trying some expansions and am very interested in giving the legacy version a shot interesting game you cooperate in controlling 4 different diseases that simultaneously threaten the world this is a great intro game and a very good cooperative game tough to beat it with 6 epidemics in the deck am anfang war ich sehr begeistert von pandemie aber bei wiederholtem spielen stellte sich dann doch etwas langeweile ein das prinzip bleibt halt immer dasselbe und auch zuf lliges kartenziehen kann nicht  ber die monotonie im spielablauf hinwegt uschen als coopspiel ist es sicherlich nicht schlecht und das erfrischende thema sorgt daf r dass pandemie mit fast jeder gruppe funktioniert aber meine begeisterung ist merklich abgek hlt vielleicht bringt die erweiterung mit ihren neuen rollenkarten und den neuen spielmodi wieder etwas mehr abwechslung rein a fantastic cooperative game good for a quick cheap thrill it requires a good degree of strategy to succeed and its always fun to finally save the world after watching it succumb to horrendous plagues three times in the last hour 3  5  good this is one of the better coop games ive come across  it offers a decent amount of chaos usually results in a tense endgame and the random role each player gets increases not only replayability but the sense of individual action however the theme is silly cash in five airline tickets for a global cure and its not totally immune from loudestplayer syndrome review here httpfortressatcomarticlesboardgamereviewspandemicreview too vulnerable to alpha gaming too abstract to be a winner for me if you have a dominating player than be prepared to be controlled remotely the expansion however does a lot of things right je me ramasse a toujours un peu trop dirig  dans ce type de jeu coop ratif ca fonctionne moins bien ces jeux dans mon cercle  mais perso je laime bien birthday present win or lose the end always seems anticlimactic to me does the expansion improve on this fun fastpaced and easy to learnteach the different options for difficulty are very nice because it can make the game more challenging one of the more popular cooperative game experiences pandemic offers its players a chance to work together in accomplishing a thematic mission to find cures and eradicate viruses as each player starts with asymmetric abilities players are encouraged to figure out the most efficient ways to deescalate the games ramping up of virus spread one issue ive seen with this game is that if youre playing with an alphagamer theyll eventually take over and everybody else just feels like theyre doing what the person says to do this stifles the fun so be careful in what groups you play this in the coop game that everyone compares others to can you stop the 4 separate pandemics from conquering the globe work together to stem their spread great gateway game js 3p 4p  w on the brink exp  sleeved infection deck uses mdg standardgreen 150 total cards very realistic coop game first times it could be really hard to win but after a while you learn what to do and then its quite easy good game to get people into the hobby rules are kept simple and its challenging while you can always discuss and help each other 14 players best 4 great game with lots of expantions finally a coop game that is 100 cooperative and gets it right and it doesnt take too long to play it was near the last turn of the game a black plague had just spread through an impressive chain of outbreaks and we lost by seconds thats when i realized i love this game acquired  traded away  in a math trade incredibly tense throughout kudos to the designer for the simple but absolutely brilliant epidemic mechanic im also impressed when a coop game manages to scale well and its usually by presenting different challenges for various numbers of players as this does it s pandemic a classic coop game though i enjoy the legacy version more now i ll still play the app version for a good solo experience buy the legacy version get the app too very fun coop it has taken a hit since legacy came out this game is fine and all but i liked forbidden island better excellent coop one of my mostplayed games and always well received with any group we play with as with any coop there can be a tendency for 1 or 2 individuals to dominate the group and try to make all the decisions but if you can avoid that its a great experience and very interactive easy to teach and the coop nature makes it very approachable for new players they dont feel like theyre competing against the more experienced players highly recommended for families and groups of casual to moderate gamers microbadge hrmicrobadge mayday  bgcolorgreencolorwhitecard gamecolorbgcolor hrmicrobadgelistitempandemic  solitaire tracker geeklist itemlistitem donn    l change de cadeau usag  after playing around 20 times starting to get bored cooperative games arent my favorite but this is one i enjoy the game can be difficult but manageable and the theme is certainly something that can be of interest to new players '"
